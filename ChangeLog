    glusterfs SEGV on Fedora 17 from UFO fallocate(2) call
    
    An upload of a file will cause the volume's glusterfs to SEGV
    when it fields a FUSE_FALLOCATE op. Swift inspects libc to determine
    if there is a symbol for fallocate(2) and if so will use it. And
    while the libc in RHEL 6 does have fallocate(2), the version of
    fuse in RHEL 6 does not support fallocate, and things are handled
    gracefully elsewhere (the kernel perhaps?)
    
    N.B. fallocate was added to version 7.19 of fuse. Fedora 17 and
    later (and maybe earlier too) has 7.19. RHEL 6 still has 7.13.
    Glusterfs uses the 7.13 version <linux/fuse.h>
    (in contrib/fuse-include/fuse_kernel.h)
    
    Thus on Fedora 17, with both fallocate(2) in libc and fallocate
    support in fuse, the fallocate invocation is dispatched to glusterfs,
    but the dispatch table (fuse_std_ops in
    xlators/mount/fuse/src/fuse-bridge.c) is too short for one thing;
    the fallocate opcode (43) indexes beyond the end of the table, and
    even when that doesn't directly cause a SEGV, the NULL pointer at
    that location does cause a SEGV when attempting to call the function
    through the pointer.

    This change include a more recent python.m4 so that newer python can be
    correctly detected.
    
    Build.gluster.com also produces a configure that fails to subsitute
    MKDIR_P, leading to bugs at make install. Works this around by
    introducing mkdirp.m4 from aclocal-1.11, with the autoconf version test
    removed because build.gluster.com also has an outdated autoconf. And
    we need a bit from a recent autoconf

    Self-heald: Fix inode leak
    
    RCA:
    There is an inode-leak because inode_link returns
    linked inode by taking a reference. That needs to be
    unreffed.
    
    Fix:
    Added the code to perform unrefs. In addition to that
    updated the loc inode with the linked-inode because that is
    the best practice. The code to update the input inode's
    gfid can be removed later, its already removed in master.
    
    Tests:
    Checked that opendir comes with an loc with valid inode
    Checked that re-opendir happens successfully. Tested index,
    full self-heal work fine with the fix.

    cluster/afr: Handle child_up & fd not opened case in xaction
    
    RCA:
    When an fd is opened while a brick is down, after the brick
    comes back up afr issues open on the other brick. It can
    fail for a number of reasons (enoent etc). While the system
    is in that state, inode/entrylks pre-op happen only on the
    brick that is up and fd is opened for fd-fops. post-op should
    consider only the bricks where both pre-op and fop succeeded
    as success, rest of them as failures. Code now marks only the
    children that are down as failures as opposed to child_down &
    fd-not-opened. This makes change-log appear as success on the
    subvolume where we did not do any fop leading to no change-log
    but differences in data/metadata for reg-files.
    
    Fix:
    Mark non-participants of fop as failure. This is tracked in
    transaction.pre_op[].
    
    Tests:
    Simulated the scenario using err-gen on top of one of the client
    xlator which fails all fops always. Performed fops and the changelog
    represented pending fops on the brick with err-gen loaded. Tested

    rpc: Reduce frame-timeout for glusterd connections
    
    Reduce frame-timeout for glusterd connections from 30mins to 10 mins. 30mins is
    too long when compared to cli timeout of 2mins. Changing to 10mins reduces the
    disparity between cli and glusterd.
    
    Also, fix glusterfs_submit_reply() so that a reply is sent even if serialize
    failed.

    core: check for pre-allocated blocks in backend fs, fix it.
    
    There is a possibility that the backend FS (like XFS) can
    allocate blocks beyond EOF for better performance reasons, which
    results in 'st_blocks' with higher values than what is consumed by
    the file descriptor. This would break few logic inside GlusterFS,
    like quota behavior etc, thus we need the exact number of blocks
    which are consumed by the file to the higher layers inside GlusterFS.
    
    Currently, this logic won't work for sparse files (ie, file with holes)

    cluster/afr: Avoid setting split-brain outside inode locks
    
    RCA:
    The bug is observed because the decision to mark
    a file in split-brain is taken outside appropriate locks.
    Lookup gathers xattrs outside any lock. The xattrs being
    in split-brain in lookup should only be taken as a hint.
    Appropriate inodelks should be taken before confirming
    a split-brain. Self-heal confirms this at the moment.
    
    Fix:
    Self-heals are launched to inspect xattrs when the
    data/metadata self-heal options are turned on.
    Decision to set/reset split-brain flag is taken inside
    appropriate locks.
    
    Known Issue After fix:
    If data/metadata self-heal is turned off, inspecting of
    xattrs could not be performed so split-brain behavior
    does not work correctly if the self-heal options are turned off.
    This bug is handled only in upstream.

    performance/io-threads: Provide option to turn off least-priority
    
    RCA:
    In cases when self-heal is in progress, self-heal fops are starved

    Fix:
    This patch provides configuring enable/disable of least-priority.

    Moved RCHECKSUM fop to low instead of least because it will still
    affect the performance of other fops if RCHECKSUM is in LEAST
    priority.
    
    Tests:
    Tested that the enabling/disabling of fops is working fine.
    Tested that RCHECKSUM fop priority is assigned LOW when

    '#define FMODE_EXEC              ((fmode_t)0x20)'
    
    Instead of adding '#include <linux/fs.h>, its better to copy this
    absolute number into other variable because then we have to deal
    with declaring fmode_t etc etc..
    
    With the fix, we can handle the file with '0711' permissions in
    the same way as backend linux filesystems.

    cluster: fix crash on link of named pipe in stripe/replicate vol
    
    A crash occurs when attempting to link a named pipe on a striped,
    replicated volume. The cause for this crash is attempting to deref
    a NULL inode pointer in stripe_link_cbk(). The RCA for this bug
    uncovered a couple of problems:
    
    - AFR ignores the inode pointer it receives on failure (returning
      NULL).
    - stripe assumes the inode pointer is valid on failure.
    
    Either one of these changes addresses the crash, but this patch
    includes both changes. AFR is modified to pass along the inode
    pointer it receives (which could still be NULL). stripe is
    modified to not assume the inode pointer is valid on fop failure.

    calls to dict_allocate_and_serialize() are not 64-bit clean
    
    All calls to dict_allocate_and_serialize() pass the address of a 32-bit
    type, but must cast it to the 64-bit pointer type (size_t *).
    
    This happens to work on LE machines, but even if it's apparently benign,
    it's still a bug. On BE machines it is not benign.
    
    GF_PROTOCOL_DICT_SERIALIZE() hacks around it by creating a size_t temp
    var, but that's, well, a hack, IMO when you consider that all the callers
    are actually passing &<u_int>; the param should just be a u_int * and
    eliminate the buggy casts and the temp var in the macro.
    
    Nobody apparently uses the Fedora/EPEL PPC RPMs, but they might. People
    are trying to build gluster.org bits on SPARC and tripping over this.

    rpc: Fixed ping timer algo.
    
    The purpose of the ping timer is to assert the absence of any evidence
    the server is possibly alive.
    
    The current implementation updates the 'last_sent' timer in the following
    points in time,
    - rpc_clnt_submit: when rpc messages are being queued at the transport
      layer. (wrong!, since we have no way to determine if server actually
      received the message)
    - rpc_clnt_notify: when client receives pollout event on sending a message
      on the 'wire'. (correct, since it indicates ACK from server)
    
    The fix removes the 'incorrect' update of 'last_sent'.

    cluster/distribute: Suppress user xattr mismatch log message
    
    Changing the log-level to DEBUG.
    Xattr mismatch can occur when parallel setxattr's race, or when
    one of the bricks was down. A subsequent setxattr will fix the
    condition when all the subvols are up. In this case, the 'user.swift'
    xattr used by ufo was out of sync, but did not cause any other error.

commit 1e1a162fa7ea5b6275a0212273ca96b4de410c00
Author: Brian Foster <bfoster@redhat.com>
Date:   Mon May 7 13:53:31 2012 -0400

    cluster/stripe: implement the coalesce stripe file format
    
    The coalesce file format for cluster/stripe condenses the striped
    files to a contiguous layout. The elimination of holes in striped
    files eliminates space wasted via local filesystem preallocation
    heuristics and significantly improves read performance.
    
    Coalesce mode is implemented with a new 'coalesce' xlator option,
    which is user-configurable and disabled by default. The format of
    newly created files is marked with a new 'stripe-coalesce' xattr.
    Cluster/stripe handles/preserves the format of files regardless
    of the current mode of operation (i.e., a volume can
    simultaneously consist of coalesced and non-coalesced files).
    Files without the stripe-coalesce attribute are assumed to have
    the traditional format to provide backward compatibility.
    
    extras/stripe-merge: support traditional and coalesce stripe formats
    
    Update the stripe-merge recovery tool to handle the traditional
    and coalesced file formats. The format of the file is detected
    automatically (and verified) via the stripe-coalesce attributes.

    geo-rep / gsyncd: fix cleanup of temporary mounts
    
    [This is a "forward port" of fafd5c17, http://review.gluster.com/2908]
    
    The "finally" clause that was meant to cleanup after the
    temp mount has not covered the case of getting signalled
    (eg. by monitor, upon worker timing out).
    
    So here we "outsource" the cleanup to an ephemeral child process.
    Child calls setsid(2) so it won't be bothered by internal process
    management. We use a pipe in between worker and the cleanup child;
    when child sees the worker end getting closed, it performs the cleanup.
    Worker end can get closed either because worker closes it (normal case),
    or because worker has terminated (faulty case) -- thus as bonus, we get
    a nice uniform handling with no need to differentiate between normal and
    faulty cases.
    
    The faulty case that was seen IRL -- ie., users of maintainance mounts
    hang in chdir(2) to mount point -- can be simulated for testing purposes
    by applying the following patch:
    
      diff --git a/xlators/mount/fuse/src/fuse-bridge.c b/xlators/mount/fuse/src/fuse-bridge.c

    When swift server receives multiple requests on a volume and if the
    volume is not mounted before hand, for each request swift tries to
    mount the GlusterFS volume on the mount point. This process is racy
    and may mount multiple times on the same mount point.
    
    Also added a new option object_only in fs.conf which should be enabled
    only if the user requires ReST interface and will have better performance.
    By default it is set "off".

    glusterd: Run post hooks on a different thread
    
    This change ensures post hooks can 'wait' if need be
    and _not_ prevent glusterd from being able to run other operations
    meanwhile.
    
    Also ensures that post hook scripts are 'serialized'
    between transactions. ie, post hook scripts of txn1 are completed
    before post hook scripts of txn2 are started, where txn1 happens before
    txn2.

      condition when gsyncd is dead/unresponsive

    geo-rep / gsyncd: add "--super" to rsync invocation
    
    This forces rsync to perform supposedly privileged operations on
    unprivileged slaves (like chown(2)).
    
    For consistent behavior (with gsyncd's "chown" RPC call that's
    being used for symlinks and directories), we also pass
    "--numeric-ids" to rsync.
    
    Also took the chance to retire gsyncd's "--rsync-extra" option
    which was there for debugging purposes (related to a resolved
    issue).

    fuse, glusterfsd: mount logic fixes
    
    Commit 7d0397c2 introduced two issues:
    
     i) broke the libfuse derived mount logic (details below)
    ii) in case of a daemonized glusterfs client is ran as daemon, parent
        process can return earlier than the mount is in place, which breaks
        agents that programmatically do a gluster mount via a direct call to
        glusterfs (ie. not via mount(8)).
    
    This patch fixes these issues by a refactor that merges the approaches
    sported by commits
    
      7d0397c2 fuse: allow requests during mount (needed for SELinux labels)
      c5d781e0 upon daemonizing, wait on mtab update to terminate in parent
    
    Original daemonized libfuse event flow is as follows:
    
      try:
        fd = open("/dev/fuse")
        mount("-oopts,fd=%s" % fd ...)
        mount(8) -f    # manipulate mtab
      except:
        sp = socketpair()
        env _FUSE_COMMFD=sp fusermount -oopts
        fd = receive_fd(sp)
    
      where fusermount(1) does:
        fd = open("/dev/fuse")
        mount("-oopts,fd=%d" % fd ...)
        sp = atoi(getenv("_FUSE_COMMFD"))
        send_fd(sp, fd)
    
      daemonize(
        # in child
        fuse_loop(fd)
      )
      # in parent
      exit()
    
    As of 013850c9 (instead of adopting FUSE's 47e61004¹), we went for async
    mtab manipulation, and as of c5d781e0, still wanted keep that in sync
    with termination of daemon parent, so we changed it to:
    
      try:
        fd = open("/dev/fuse")
        mount("-oopts,fd=%s" % fd ...)
        pid = fork(
          # in child
          mount(8) -f
        )
      except:
        sp = socketpair()
        env _FUSE_COMMFD=sp fusermount -oopts
        fd = receive_fd(sp)
    
      daemonize(
        fuse_loop(fd)
      )
      waitpid(pid)
      exit()
    
    (Note the new approch came only to direct [privileged] mount, so fusermount
    based mounting was already partially broken.)
    
    As of 7d0397c2, with the purpose of facilitating async mount, the event flow
    was practically reduced to:
    
      fd = open("/dev/fuse")
      fork(
        mount("-oopts,fd=%s" % fd ...)
        fork(
          mount(8) -n
        )
      )
    
      daemonize(
        fuse_loop(fd)
      )
      exit()
    
    Thus fusermount based mounting become defunct; however, the dead
    code was still kept around. So, we should either drop it or fix
    it. Also, the mtab manipulator is forked into yet another child
    with no purpose, while syncing with it in daemon parent is broken.
    mount(2) is neither synced with parent.
    
    Now we are coming to the following scheme:
    
      fd = open("/dev/fuse")
      pid = fork(
        try:
          mount("-oopts,fd=%s" % fd ...)
          mount(8) -n
        except:
          env _FUSE_DEVFD=fd fusermount -oopts
      )
    
      where fusermount(1) does:
        fd = getenv("_FUSE_DEVFD")
        mount("-oopts,fd=%s" % fd ...)
    
      daemonize(
        fuse_loop(fd)
      )
      waitpid(pid)
      exit()
    
    Nb.:
    
    - We can't help losing compatibility with upstream fusermount,
      as it sends back the fd only when mount(2) is completed,
      thus defeating the async mount approach. The
      'getenv("_FUSE_DEVFD")' mechanism is specfic to glusterfs'
      fusermount (at the moment -- sure we can talk about it with
      upstream)
    
    - fusermount opens /dev/fuse at same privilege level as of
      original process², so we can bravely go on with doing the open
      unconditionally in original process
    
    - Original mounting code actually tries to mount through
      fusermount _twice_: if first attempt fails, then, assuming
      subtype support is missing in kernel, it tries again subtype
      stripped. However, this is redundant, as fusermount internally
      also performs the subtype check³. Therefore we simplified the
      logic to have just a single fusermount call.
    
    - we revert the changes to mount.glusterfs as of 7d0397c2, as
      now there is no issue with glusterfs to work around in that scope

    The list of fds on which open needs to be done as part of unlink,
    was being modified at different places using different locks.
    This resulted in a race-condition where open was marked as in-transit,
    but fdctx was removed from the list of fds on which open was being
    sent even before open was done. Because of this, open_in_transit would
    be set forever (as an open was never actually sent, there would be no
    open_cbk called and hence we could not reset the variable), blocking
    all the future fd based fops on this fd.

    in fresh lookup, the inode would not have linked to the inode table

    geo-rep / gsyncd: recognize ECONNABORTED as termination of aux glusterfs
    
    Don't dump stack, rather log the "glusterfs session went down" message.
    
    If the aux glusterfs is already dead when we try to do some file
    operation, we get a failure with ENOTCONN, which is already handled
    as above. However, it's also possible that glusterfs dies while we
    are in a syscall into it -- in that case we get ECONNABORTED, and
    so far then we end up with an ugly stack strace. From now on we
    take ECONNABORTAD as well into consideration.
    
    Nb. wrt. testing: it's not easy to synthetically force the aux glusterfs
    to end this way; for that we have to provoke gsyncd into intensive
    synchronization. I succeeded in that with the following ruby oneliner:
    
    ruby -rcgi -e '
      Dir.chdir($*[0])
      a=[]
      Thread.new { loop { while a.size >= 100; File.delete a.shift; end; sleep 1 }}
      loop { a<<CGI.escape(STDIN.read 10); open(a[-1], "w") {}}' MTPT < /dev/urandom
    
    where the geo-rep master is mounted at MTPT. With this going on, deliver a
    SIGKILL to the geo-rep session's aux glusterfs. (It is giving ECONNABORTED

    glusterd: On-wire changes required for probe/detach errstr
    
    This patch changes the on-wire structures for 'peer probe' and 'peer detach' to
    include op_errstr. These changes have been backported from patches
    feb99ca (glusterd, cli: Enable errstr for peer probe) and
    3213a4e (glusterd,cli: Enable errstr for peer detach). The remaining changes
    will be included later on.

    geo-rep / gsyncd: fixes regarding the command invocation framework
    
    Some of the bugs to fix were found by the following stress-test:
    make "glusterfs --client-pid=-1" exit immediately on slave
    side.
    
    Also fix eintr_wrap which should not "adopt" exceptions generated
    by the wrapped call, by re-raising them as GsyncdError.

    Instead of the apporach of the original coverity fix

    glusterd: Fixed glusterd_brick_create_path algo.
    
    - check if any prefix of the brick path has "trusted.gfid"
      or "trusted.glusterfs.volume-id" set.
    - set trusted.glusterfs.volume-id on the bricks as soon as
      its induction into the volume is settled. Earlier, the setting of
      "volume-id" used to happen during the first run of the brick process,
      leaving of window for bricks part of one volume to be (ab)used by another
      volume inadvertently.
    - removed creation of brick directory (if missing), during start volume force.
      This is to avoid directory creation as part 'force'ful starting of volume
      and leave the responsibility with the user, who understands the
      'availability' of the export directory (brick) better.

    libglusterfs/fd: while dumping the fd_ctx use fd->xl_count
    
    While dumping the fd_ctx when statedump is issued fd->xl_count should be
    used to determine the number of xlators instead of using latest graph's count,
    since while creating the fd only those many slots would have been allocated
    as the number of xlators in the graph at that instant. Then the graph would have
    changed, thus the xl count.
    
    All the above things should happen before any operation is done on fd, otherwise
    fd_ctx_set will allocate the extra slots for the new xlators present in the
    graph.
    
    Also added the program which can be used to reproduce the bug.

    nfs/nlm: procedures for PC clients
    
    *  This change introduces four NLMv4 procedures:
    
       NM_LOCK, SHARE, UNSHARE and FREE_ALL.
    
       These are used by PC clients (windows/dos) to control access
       to files.
    
       1. NM_LOCK: this lock is not monitored by statd.
    
       2. SHARE: A share reservation is a lock on the whole file
          that is taken whenever a file is opened on windows clients.
          This has ACCESS (N, R, W, RW) and DENY MODE (N, R, W, RW).
            ACCESS:    mode of access requested by the client;
            DENY MODE: what the requesting client wants to
                       deny other clients.
    
       3. UNSHARE: remove a share reservation obtained by SHARE.
          Called while closing a file.
    
       4. FREE_ALL: remove all share reservations and locks,
          both monitored and unmonitored, of the calling client.
    
    *  lock and nm_lock use a common function with only
       a flag conveying whether or not to monitor a lock.
    
    *  NOTES:
       1. SHARE reservations are not STACK_WIND'd to subsequent xlators.
          These are maintained in-memory in the nfs xlator.
    
       2. Consequently, for SHARE reservations to work effectively,
          all PC clients  *must* mount from the same gNfs server.
          Not doing so will result in different servers maintaining
          separate SHARE reservations which will not be enforced
          for obvious reasons.

    mgmt/glusterd: Avoid re-starting nfs unconditionally.
    
    NFS server is restarted unconditionally when a volume option is
    configured through the set interface. This patch prevents restart
    of NFS server when operations are performed on translators that
    are not part of the NFS graph.
    
    This does not prevent re-start of a NFS server when an option
    corresponding to a translator that is part of the NFS graph is

    When parent is root, the parent inode returned will always be

    quick-read, md-cache: selectively cache xattr data to conserve memory
    
    The md-cache translator can cache items for a long period of time and
    thus is sensitive to memory usage associated with the items it
    references. This implements two changes to help conserve memory:
    
    - quick-read - Migrate the file content data to a local dict and
    	delete from the xdata dict that passes through the stack.
    - md-cache - Create a local dict to selectively store the xattr
    	data md-cache is interested in. This includes a slight
    	optimization to not allocate an empty dict in the case
    	where we have not received any xattr's of interest.
    
    I've tested both changes independently and together by running a
    readdirp test against several compiled source trees (~340k files).
    The base test results in a 7.7GB RSS on the client. The quick-read
    modification cuts RSS down to 4.1GB, which is still large due
    to md-cache unintelligently caching a large number of empty
    dictionaries. The combined modification cuts RSS down to 462MB
    on the same workload.
    
    NOTE: Theoretically the md-cache change should supercede the
    quick-read change, but practically I save an extra 150MB or so with
    both. I already had the change and consider it an improvement that
    quick-read clean up after itself.

    libgluster: Fix counting, synctask state errors
    
    When a synctask is executed in synctask_switchto, if by the time
    it goes to check the woken/sleep part a reply already comes and
    __wake is called, already running task is going to be put in runq
    this generates a false warning "re-running already running task".
    
    If the reply does not come before the woken/sleep check, then the
    running task is put in waitq which decrements env->runcount even
    when the task is not in runq, this leads to -ve runcount everytime
    a task goes from runq->switchto->waitq.
    
    This patch fixes both of them by introducing a new state for the

    libglusterfs/fd: use reallocated memory for intializing new graphs contexts
    
    While setting fd_ctx, if we have to scale the fd contexts, then we get the
    xl_count of the new graph and reallocate the memory for contexts so that
    it is suffecient for contexts of xlators of both new as well as old graph, and
    then initialize the new graph xlator contexts. For that we are considering the
    old pointer itself, instead of using newly reallocated pointer.

    due to the patch 29f2de478cc6a475e6ae760d9cbe7ac847e9d79c (coverity
    issues fix), geo-replications assumption of anything other than -2
    is valid error (ie, expected error), was broken, which resulted in
    staging failure of all geo-replication commands. now fixed!!!

    mount/fuse: unref the fds after they have been migrated to the new graph
    
    In fuse upon graph changes fds were being migrated to the new graph.
    It was done by taking all the fds from the fdtable in a structure and then
    migrating each fd in the structure to the new graph. But after the fds
    are migrated the structure which had the fds within it (that is refed fds)
    was being freed without unrefing the fds, thus leading to a fd leak.

    statedump: fix deadlock during state dump of fds
    
    Existing state dump of FD context tries to be extra safe by trying
    to call the fd dump callback outside the inode lock. It acheives
    this by taking an fd ref and unreffing it later. This exercise can
    be harmful at times when the fd unref performed by state dump ends
    up being the last unref and triggers fd_destroy. fd_destroy in turn
    triggers inode_unref which blocks on inode table lock, while the
    inode table lock was already held by the thread before it even
    attempted fd ctx dump.
    
    The fix takes away the dangerous ref/unref of the fd during state
    dump and instead calls fd_ctx_dump() whiel the inode lock is held.
    This is not a problem as long as the dump functions do not call any
    inode function which tries to take an inode lock (none of the
    existing fd dump ops do)

    clean up handling of special client pids
    
    - no need to name a lower boundary [drop GF_CLIENT_PID_MIN]
    - drop utility function to decide about pid speciality [gf_pid_client_check()];
      when we implement uniform policy for special pids, use just comparison with
      GF_CLIENT_PID_MAX (currently such uniform policy exists in io-threads, where
      special clients get lowest priority)
    - io-threads: drop numeric literal, use GF_CLIENT_PID_MAX
    - xattr flipping (in fuse):
      - fuse_xattr_alloc_default() made static
      - avoid compiler warnings wrt. partial enum traversal in the switch
        by not casting the original numeric value to gf_client_pid_t (enum) type
      - trim down the switch to those cases with which there is something to do
        [GF_CLIENT_PID_GSYNCD, GF_CLIENT_PID_HADOOP]
      - eliminate the (theoretical) chance of succesfully returning
        from fuse_flip_xattr_ns() with unallocated nkey
        [as was the case with pids GF_CLIENT_PID_{MIN,MAX,DEFRAG}]

    cluster/distribute: handle dht_layout_normalize errors differently in
    dht_lookup_dir_cbk and dht_discover_complete.
    
    return value from dht_layout_normalize is interpreted as follows:
    
    ret > 0 - number of subvolumes returned ENOENT errors.
    ret = 0 - no anomalies found.
    ret < 0 - there are holes/overlaps.
    
    We need to handle errors differently in dht_discover_cbk because,
    if a subvolume is newly added, the directory will not be present on it
    and we cannot create a directory there since a nameless lookup has
    resulted execution in this code-path. Hence if directory is guaranteed
    to be present in atleast one subvolume and there are no holes/overlaps
    in the layout, lookup can be treated as successful.
    
    there is no change in behaviour dht_lookup_dir_cbk caused by this
    patch.

    cluster/afr: Handle transient parent-entry xactions in lookup
    
    This patch addresses the case when the lookup on an entry is performed
    while it is being renamed. The lookup can possibly return 2 different
    gfids when lookup on one subvol reached before rename and on other
    after rename. In such cases the conflicting entry self-heal is
    triggered to resolve the issue, but if there are lot entry transactions
    going on the parent directory of the entry then the non-blocking
    locks could fail resulting in EIO. To avoid this, lookup queries
    locks xlator if there are any parent-entrylk on entry's basename.
    If afr finds that there are such locks and gfids are differing then
    it chooses the file with latest ctime as the iatt of the entry.
    This solution is not foolproof, but it decreases the probability of
    hitting the EIO. The correct solution is to take blocking locks on
    the parent-entry to find out the correct source. Taking blocking
    locks in lookup is not good. One stale entry lock can hang the whole
    filesystem. So we chose to go with this for now.

    In cli, frame->local is not allocated from the internal mempool, rather its

    Otherwise if frame->local is not NULL, STACK_DESTROY will try to put it back

    3. obtain volname using key "master" prevent "volume geo-replication" commands
       from failing
    
    Also, fails op and sets correct op_errstr if volume not found during

    * noticed that the regex to parse the options were not fool proof.
      for example, 'ro' in a logfilename could have made the mount

    * this issue existed for 'acl', 'worm' options.
    
    * log-server/log-server-port options were legacy, and no more
      needed in codebase.
    
    * refactored option processing in general to avoid above issues

    glusterd: Added volume-id to 'op' dictionary
    
    Volume-id passed in op dictionary would help detect possible split brains
    among peers in a cluster. The idea is to check if the volume's id and
    the vol-id that was passed are equal.
    ie, same volume name, but different volume id indicate that glusterd
    'metadata' of one of the participating peers is stale or there is
    a split brain.
    
    This is over and above the existing checksum based validation of peer
    supplied cluster 'metadata' (ie, volume info file).

    md-cache: fix dict memory leak in mdc_inode_xatt_update
    
    We currently either dict_ref() or dict_copy() into mdc->xattr.
    The double dict_ref() call path is obvious. Alternatively,
    dict_copy() does not ref the dict in the situation where it
    creates a new dict, but we only call dict_copy() in this
    context when we already have a dict, which should mean the
    extra ref is unnecessary.

    storage/posix: Avoid excessive logging in posix.
    
    When quota or gsyncd is enabled, the marker translator performs setxattr on
    files/directories. If the file/directory is deleted before setxattr, posix gets
    an error when it does setxattr and logs it. But its not an error for marker and
    it handles the case gracefully. Hence, avoid logging for these keys.

    Replace GPLV3 MD5 with OpenSSL MD5
    
    Ric asked me to look at replacing the GPL licensed MD5 code with
    something better, i.e. perhaps faster, and with a less restrictive
    license, etc. So I took a couple hour holiday from working on
    wrapping up the client_t and did this.
    
    OpenSSL (nee SSLeay) is released under the OpenSSL license, a BSD/MIT
    style license. OpenSSL (libcrypto.so) is used on Linux, OS X and *BSD,
    Open Solaris, etc. IOW it's universally available on the platforms we
    care about. It's written by Eric Young (eay), now at EMC/RSA, and I
    can say from experience that the OpenSSL implementation of MD5 (at least)
    is every bit as fast as RSA's proprietary implementation (primarily
    because the implementations are very, very similar.) The last time I
    surveyed MD5 implementations I found they're all pretty much the same
    speed.
    
    I changed the APIs (and ABIs) for the strong and weak checksums.
    Strictly speaking I didn't need to do that. They're only called on
    short strings of data, i.e. pathnames, so using int32_t and uint32_t
    is ostensibly okay. My change is arguably a better, more general API
    for this sort of thing. It's also what bit me when gerrit/jenkins
    validation failed due to glusterfs segv-ing. (I didn't pay close enough
    attention to the implementation of the weak checksum. But it forced me
    to learn what gerrit/jenkins are doing and going forward I can do better
    testing before submitting to gerrit.)
    
    Now resubmitting with a BZ

    libglusterfs/run: POSIX compatible closing of child fds on non-Linux
    
    It just occurred to me that I realized there are POSIX features that let this be
    done cleanly. However, For Linux we keep the proc based approach to get more
    graceful strace logs.

    add the possibility to pass an integer which makes

    This makes it possible to investigate post-test

    md-cache: fix time comparison to support 0 timeout
    
    The time comparison currently causes caching when the current
    time matches the timeout. This causes caching to occur even
    when the timeout parameter is set to 0. Fix the condition to
    support the no caching scenario. A longer term approach is to
    use gettimeofday() for more accurate granularity, but this
    apparently fixes a known bug.

    <glusterd-working-dir>/hooks/version/create/pre
    
    <glusterd-working-dir>/hooks/version/create/post
    
    where, version corresponds to the version of hook scripts.
    
    The scripts beginning with 'S' under the above directories would be run before
    (pre) and after (post) the volume created. The scripts would receive a command
    line argument as below:
    --volname=<volname>
    
    This can be optionally used  by the script.

    cli,glusterd: more volume status improvements
    
    The major changes are,
    * "volume status" now supports getting details of the self-heal daemon processes
    for replica volumes. A new cli options "shd", similar to "nfs", has been
    introduced for this. "detail", "fd" and "clients" status ops are not supported
    for self-heal daemons.
    * The default/normal ouput of "volume status" has been enhanced to contain
    information about nfs-server and self-heal daemon processes as well. Some tweaks
    have been done to the cli output to show appropriate output.
    
    Also, changes have been done to rebalance/remove-brick status, so that hostnames
    are displayed instead of uuids.

    cluster/afr: handle fstat failure in data-self-heal
    
    The final fstat which makes the call_count 0 could be a failure.
    In that case the buf could either be NULL or buf is all zeros.
    If buf is NULL then it will crash, if it is all zeros
    buf->ia_type will be IA_INVAL and it proceeds to special file fix.
    sh->type is assigned with the ia_type of the file to be healed.
    I modified the code to depend on that instead.

    A grace timer is registered on a disconnect, but a reconnect timer sends a
    connect request after every 3sec and if the server is down, the client protocol
    receives disconnect and a grace timer will be registered which on timeout will
    increase the lk-version value. Its enough to register the grace timer once after
    the first disconnect and later just ignore other psuedo disconnects until the
    next successful reconnect.

    glusterd: Fixed replace-brick commit_force algo.
    
    - commit force subcommand of replace-brick (rb) should be allowed
      even if source brick is (irrecoverably) offline.
    - modified rb_timer to be active only for start subcommand. This is
      important since, the rb timer event relies on src_brick and dst_brick
      objects to be 'alive' when it 'happens'. In the case of
      abort/commit/commit force it is very likely that src_brick and/or
      dst_brick objects could have been destroyed.

    current code is such that, rpc_clnt_connection_cleanup() does

    cluster/stripe: fix {set/get}xattr query for dirs/symlink
    
    This patch fixes the following problems:
    * ENOENT returned for getxattr (xtime) on symlinks
        Non-data entities are created only on the first subvolume but
        getxattr fop winds to all subvols. This results in all subvols
        except the first one to return ENOENT which is propogated down
        the stack.
    
    * ENODATA returned for getxattr (xtime) on directory
        setxattr calls always wind to the first stripe subvolume.
        xtime getxattr invocation winds to all subvolumes but the
        xattr is present in only the first one, resulting in all
        subvols except the first one to return ENODATA.
    
    Fix
    
      For symlinks getxattr now always winds to the first subvol and
      for directories setxattr sets the xattr on all subvols.
    
    NOTE
    
       For directories the all-subvol-wind in setxattr is done
       only when request is from a special client (client-pid == -1)

    rpc: cancel reconnect timer in rpc_clnt_disable
    
    When the graph is considered no longer needed, rpc_clnt_disable
    is called, which disconnects the connection to server but the
    reconnect timer is not cancelled in that function, so it is
    reconnecting to the server before the grace-time-period.
    The locks of the disabled graph are still there on the server
    which are leading to hangs.

    protocol/server: send forget on the renamed inode
    
    If rename is given on a file "a" to "b" ("b" is already existing file),
    then after rename, the inode for "b" would still be in the inode table
    and would not get forget (for fuse client, the fuse kernel module would
    send, but on server forget will not come on that inode), thus leading
    to inode leak even when the mount point is empty.
    
    To avoid that before doing inode rename, unlink the previous inode that
    "b" is pointing to and send forget on that, if "b" is the last dentry
    for that inode.

    valid_internet_address(), valid_ipv4_address() & valid_ipv6_address() functions
    has been updated for * wildcard matching. Previously used standalone wildcard
    address checking functions have been removed.
    
    Changes have been done to stripe translator to correctly set, update and use
    stripe-blocksize. Also minimum value for block-size has been set to 16KB.

    Updated the Ubuntu upstart jobs for glusterd in extras/Ubuntu.
    
    Using upstart jobs, instead of an initscript, solves Bug 765014.
    See also: https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/glusterfs/+bug/876648
    
    The new upstart jobs split the work of starting glusterd & mounting glusterfs volumes into two parts: a glusterd service runner and a glusterfs volume moung blocker which waits for the service runner.
    
    This is the method preferred by Ubuntu developers to block a mounting event until a required service is available.  These changes will be included in the Ubuntu glusterfs-server package starting with release 12.04, Precise Pangolin.
    
    Tested on Ubuntu 12.04

    protocol/server: add and remove the transports from the list, inside the lock
    
    Till now for graph changes, glusterfs client used to remember the old graph
    also. Hence the transport object on the server corresponding the old graph
    never received disconnect. But now since the graph cleanup is happening,
    transport on the server side gets disconnect for the cleaned up graph.
    
    Server maintains, all the transports in a list. But addition of the new
    transport to the list, or removal of the transport from the list is not
    happening within the lock. Thus if a thread is accessing a transport
    (in cases of statedump, where each transprt's information is dumped),
    and the server gets a disconnect on that transport, then it leads to
    segfault of the process.
    
    To avoid it do the list (of transports) manipulation inside the lock.

    core: bring a cmdline option to set memory-accounting
    
    currently this is implemented as a command line option, and not
    as an easier translator option. this is because as of now, before
    even the volume files are parsed, we would need memory accounting
    enabled. there is scope for improving this behavior, but for now,
    this approach solves the problem.
    
    Also, this feature's major consumers are the testers who are
    looking for leaks, hence option is hidden from usage output.

    Comma can be used in the value of a "mountbroker-geo-replication.*" option
    with semantics as of these examples:
    
      option mountbroker-geo-replication.foolabel vol1,vol2,vol3:geouser
    
    and
    
      option mountbroker-geo-replication.geouser vol1,vol2,vol3
    
    will allow geouser to mount any of the volumes vol{1,2,3} with params of a
    geo-rep aux mount under label foolabel, resp. geouser
    
    Also fix memleak in parsing of this option.

    nfs: do not call inode_path on the newly created inode
    
    While resolving, for building the path into the loc, inode_find
    is called with gfid as argument to get the inode from the inode
    table. If the inode is not found, then a new inode is created.
    Then the path is build using inode_path. But if the inode is
    not linked to inode table (newly created inode), then gfid will
    be null and inode_path returns null gfid as the path. Suppose the
    lookup operation on that gfid fails, then we print the null gfid
    in the log message.
    
    To avoid it, build the path using the gfid only if inode_path
    fails.

    cluster/afr: handle sending NULL dentry name for inode link in self-heal-daemon
    
    * Without the dentry name, dentry cannot be created in inode_link, which
     leads to trying to access the null dentry to check if it is cyclic and
     thus segfault. So send the parent inode also NULL, which just returns
     the proper inode after assigning the gfid and type to the inode without
     trying to create dentry.
    
    * Handle failures such as dentry_create returning NULL, in inode_link
      properly and return NULL in such cases.
    
    * Increase the lru limit of inode table of self-heal-daemon to 2048

    cli, glusterd, nfs: "volume status|profile|top" for nfs servers
    
    Enables usage of volume monitoring operations "volume status", "volume top" and
    "volume profile" for nfs servers. These operations can be performed on
    nfs-servers  by passing "nfs" as an option in cli. The output is similar to the
    normal brick outputs for these commands.
    
    The new syntaxes for the changed commands are as below,
     #gluster volume profile <VOLNAME> {start|info|stop} [nfs]
     #gluster volume top <VOLNAME> {[open|read|write|opendir|readdir [nfs]]
                   |[read-perf|write-perf [nfs|{bs <size> count <count>}]]}
                   [brick <brick>] [list-cnt <count>]
     #gluster volume status [all | <VOLNAME> [nfs|<BRICK>]]

    If an entry includes no ACL returned via dictionary, it is possible
    to skip down to acl_set without updating acl_access and/or
    acl_default. If either are set from the previous iteration, the
    unrelated ACLs are set to the current entry. Use a single set of
    pointers to ensure that valid ACLs are always set.

    protocol/server: Remove connection from conf->conns w.o. race
    
    1) Adding the connection to conf->conns used to
    happen in conf->mutex, but removing happened under conn->lock.
    Fixed that as below.
    When the connection object is created conn's ref, bind_ref count
    is set to '1'. For bind_ref ref/unref happens under conf->mutex
    whenever server_connection_get, put is called.
    When bind_ref goes to '0' connection object is removed from
    conf->conns under conf->mutex.  After it is removed from the list,
    conn_unref is called outside the conf->mutex.
    conn_ref/unref still happens under conn->lock.
    
    2) Fixed races in server_connection_cleaup in grace_timer_handler
    and server_setvolume.

    If the {f}xattrop operation succeeds on one of the subvolumes and fails
    on another (thus the xattr dict obtained from the failed subvolume in
    the callback will be NULL), then afr would be unwinding with op_ret = 0
    (since the operation was successful on one subvolume), but the xattr dict
    would be NULL (afr is not saving the xattr it has received in the callback
    in its local structure and will send the xattr it has received in the last
    callback). xlators above afr might segfault when they access the xattr since
    they would have assumed that xattr would be present as op_ret is 0.

    syncop: Make syntask scalable
    
    At the moment, synctask uses task->frame to perform
    all the syncops, this will lead to high-memory usage if the task
    crawls millions of directories. i.e millions of STACK_WINDS/UNWINDS.
    To prevent this, in each task a new stack is created to perform
    the fops which is reset after every syncop.

    cluster/afr: copy the parent's gfid from child loc while building parent loc
    
    Suppose the process is not a fuse or nfs mounted client, and some other process
    such as rebalance, then after lookups inode would not be linked to the inode
    table (since the inode was created for rebalance purpose only), thus keeping
    inode's gfid NULL.
    
    And afr while building the parent loc using child loc, does not copy the
    pargfid present in child'd loc structure. protocol/client will search for
    the gfid either in loc or in loc->inode and assert if it cannot find the
    gfid in either of them.

    transport/socket: configuring tcp window-size
    
    Till now, send and recieve buffer window sizes for sockets
    were set to a default glusterfs-specific value.
    Linux's default window sizes have been found to be better
    w.r.t performance, and hence, no more setting it to any
    default value.
    
    However, if one wishes, there's the new configuration option:
       network.tcp-window-size <sane_size>
    which takes a size value (int or human readable) and will set
    the window size of sockets for both clients and servers.
    Nfs clients will also be updated with the same.

    mempool: add more counters to understand the usage scenarios properly
    
    current design of mempool is to fallback to standard calloc/free if
    all the buffers in pool are exhausted. Understanding more about those
    numbers will help us to tune mempool parameters properly over time.

    core: utilize mempool for frame->local allocations
    
    in each translator, which uses 'frame->local', we are using
    GF_CALLOC/GF_FREE, which would be costly considering the
    number of allocation happening in a lifetime of 'fop'. It
    would be good to utilize the mem pool framework for xlator's
    local structures, so there is no allocation overhead.

    fuse-bridge: Handle graph-switch.
    
    The purpose of this patch is to let protocol/client know when its transports can
    be disconnected, without application running on gluster mount noticing any
    effects of graph switch.
    
    In order to do this, we migrate all fds and blocked locks to new graph.
    Once this migration is complete and there are no in-transit frames as viewed
    by fuse-bridge, we send a PARENT_DOWN event to its children. protocol/client
    on receiving this event, can disconnect up its transports.

    md-cache: meta-data caching translator
    
    This is a metadata caching translator which is well integrated with
    glusterfs core framework and leverages some of the recent protocol
    changes to do a better job at caching.
    
    - It uses the attributes returned along callbacks of all calls to
      update its attribute cache as frequently as possible without
      issuing calls on its own (i.e, very low overhead)
    
    - It caches attributes returned via readdirp into the inode contexts
      corresponding to those entries (i.e, well integrated)
    
    - It caches and updates xattrs and not just inode attributes (i.e,
      eliminates the need for a separate xattr-prefetch translator)
    
    In its current form it has a timeout based consistency model

    protocol/client,server: fcntl lock self healing.
    
    Currently(with out this patch), on a disconnect the server cleans up
    the transport which inturn closes the fd's and releases the locks acquired on
    those fd's by that client. On a reconnect, client just reopens the fd's but
    doesn't reacquire the locks. The application that had previously acquired
    the locks still is under the assumption that it is the owner of those locks
    which might have been granted to other clients(if they request) by the server
    leading to data corruption.
    
    This patch allows the client to reacquire the fcntl locks (held on the fd's)
    during client-server handshake.
    
    * The server identifies the client via process-uuid-xl (which is a combination
      of uuid and client-protocol name, it is assumed to be unique) and lk-version
      number.
    
    * The client maintains a list of process-uuid-xl, lk-version pair for each
      accepted connection. On a connect, the server traverses the list for a
      matching pair, if a matching pair is not found the the server returns
      lk-version with value 0, else it returns the lk-version it has in store.
    
    * On a disconnect, the server and client enter grace period, and on the
      completion of the grace period, the client bumps up its lk-version number
      (which means, it will reacquire the locks the next time) and the server will
      distroy the connection. If reconnection happens within the grace period, the
      server will find the matching (process-uuid-xl, lk-version) pair in its list
      which guarantees that the fd's and there corresponding locks are still valid
      for this client.
    
    Configurable options:
      To set grace-timeout, the following options are
        option server.grace-timeout value
        option client.grace-timeout value
    
      To enable or disable the lk-heal,
        option lk-heal [on|off]
    
    gluster volume set command can be used to configurable options

    glusterd: auth allow enhancements
    
    * PROBLEM:
    
      When address-based authentication is enabled on a volume,
      the gNfs server, self-heal daemon (shd), and other operations
      such as quota, rebalance, replace-brick and geo-replication
      either stop working or the services are not started if all
      the peers' ipv{4,6} addresses or hostnames are not added in
      the "set auth.allow" operation, breaking the functionality
      of several operations.
    
      E.g:
        volume vol in a cluster of two peers:
        /mnt/brick1 in 192.168.1.4
        /mnt/brick2 in 192.168.1.5
    
        option auth.allow 192.168.1.6
        (allow connection requests only from 192.168.1.6)
    
        This will disrupt the nfs servers on 192.168.1.{4,5}.
        brick server processes reject connection requests from both
        nfs servers (on 4,5), because the peer addresses are not in
        the auth.allow list.
    
        Same holds true for local mounts (on peer machines),
        self-heal daemon, and other operations which perform
        a glusterfs mount on one of the peers.
    
    * SOLUTION:
    
      Login-based authentication (username/password pairs,
      henceforth referred to as "keys") for gluster services and
      operations.
    
      These *per-volume* keys can be used to by-pass the addr-based
      authentication, provided none of the peers' addresses are put
      in the auth.reject list, to enable gluster services like gNfs,
      self-heal daemon and internal operations on volumes when
      auth.allow option is exercised.
    
    * IMPLEMENTATION:
    
      1. Glusterd generates keys for each volume and stores it in
         memory as well as in respective volfiles.
         A new TRUSTED-FUSE volfile is generated which is
         fuse volfile + keys in protocol/client,
         and is named trusted-<volname>-fuse.vol.
         This is used by all local mounts. ANY local mount (on any peer)
         is granted the trusted-fuse volfile instead of fuse volfile
         via getspec. non-local mounts are NOT granted the trusted fuse
         volfile.
    
      2. The keys generated for the volume is written to each server
         volfile telling servers to allow users with these keys.
    
      3. NFS, self-heal daemon and replace-brick volfiles are updated
         with the volume's authentication keys.
    
      4. The keys are NOT written to fuse volfiles for obvious reasons.
    
      5. The ownership of volfiles and logfiles is restricted to root users.
    
      6. Merging two identical definitions of peer_info_t in auth/addr
         and rpc-lib, throwing away the one in auth/addr.
    
      7. Code cleanup in numerous places as appropriate.
    
    * IMPORTANT NOTES:
    
      1. One SHOULD NOT put any of the peer addresses in the auth.reject
         list if one wants any of the glusterd services and features
         such as gNfs, self-heal, rebalance, geo-rep and quota.
    
      2. If one wants to use username/password based authentication
         to volumes, one shall append to the server, nfs and shd volfiles,
         the keys one wants to use for authentication, *while_retaining
         those_generated_by_glusterd*.
         See doc/authentication.txt file for details.

    cluster/dht: Support for hardlink rebalance when decommissioning
    
    The support for hardlink rebalance is only available for decommissioning
    of a node. this can be triggered in two ways
    1. remove-brick start
    2. if decommission node value is set in vol file, then a normal rebalance
       command
    
    The way we handle it is-
    if (nlink > 1)
    do
           * if src file doesnt have linkto xattr
                    * mark src's linkto to the dst
           * else
                    * perform a link on the dst
                    * do a look up
                    * if nlinks = dst.nlinks
                            * migrate data
                    * else

    posix: handle some internal behavior in posix_mknod()
    
    assume a case of link() systemcall, which is handled in distribute by
    creating a 'linkfile' in hashed subvolume, if the 'oldloc' is present
    in different subvolume. we have same 'gfid' for the linkfile as that
    of file for consistency. Now, a file with multiple hardlinks, we may
    end up with 'hardlinked' linkfiles. dht create linkfile using 'mknod()'
    fop, and as now posix_mknod() is not equipped to handle this situation.
    
    this patch fixes the situation by looking at the 'internal' key set in
    the dictionary to differentiate the call which originates from inside
    with regular system calls.

    cli: Enable output in XML
    
    This patch enables gluster cli to output data in xml format. XML output can be
    obtained by passing "--xml" as an argument.
    
    A new "volume list" command, which lists the volumes present in a cluster, has
    been added. This can be used for obtaining a quick list of volumes.
    
    Several commands, including "volume top", "volume profile", "volume status" and
    "volume info", "volume list", have custom XML output routines. Other commands
    use either one of the 2 generic output routines, cli_xml_output_str() &
    cli_xml_output_dict().
    NOTE: When using "all" for "volume status" and "volume info" the XML output will
    have multiple roots.

    mgmt/glusterd: changes to run nfs server and self-heal daemon with valgrind
    
    Currently glusterd can start only the brick processes in the valgrind mode.
    This patch ensures that nfs server and self-heal daemon are also started
    with valgrind along with the bricks.

    nfs: avoid logging invalid fdctx in case of anonymous fds
    
    if get_fd_ctx fails (as in case of anonymous fds), overwhelming
    amount of entries are seen in the nfs log, causing dd and other
    heavy i/o operations to become unresponsive. this patch logs an
    invalid fdctx only if it is not an anonymous fd.

    protocol xdr: remove 'path<>'
    
    client was sending 'path' on wire, which gets ignored on server
    side, and also doesn't get freed up, which causes memory leak.
    
    also with not having path on wire, the xdr size on wire most of the
    time can remain constant, which helps in allocating RDMA buffers.

    protocol/client : prevent client from reconnecting when server
    authentication fails
    
    This prevents the client from trying to reconnect on server
    authentication failure. Reconnecting on authentcation failure causes hung
    mounts on unauthorised clients. This patch fixes this problem.
    
    Also, mount.glusterfs script unmounts mount-point on mount failure to
    prevent hung mounts.

    glusterd: Changed op_sm_queue locking mechanism to accomodate nested calls to op_sm
    
    Today if an rpc call made inside an op_sm can fail due to a disconnected peer,
    resulting in the rpc callback to be called in the same stack with appropriate
    status set. All glusterd rpc cbks move the state machine based on the status
    returned by the rpc layer, which would result in a nested call to op_sm. With
    the current scheme of locking, glusterd would end up in a deadlock situation
    
    The new scheme will fail the nested glusterd_op_sm (). This prevents the
    deadlock.  It would work without any change in overall behaviour, as the
    current op_sm () call in execution wouldn't return until all events in the
    queue are processed.

    After gfid based backend changes loc will either contain the gfid of the inode
    or it will contain the parent gfid and the name of the entry. So before unwinding

    cluster/afr: Perform xattrop with all afr-keys
    
    Self-heal does not happen if the file has change log xattr
    only for one of the subvol keys. This patch makes sure that
    xattrop is done for all the afr subvol keys after a new entry
    is created in entry-self-heal.
    
    1) Added matrix create/cleanup functions
    2) Impunging a new file does multiple xattrops on the source
    subvol, one per sink. The code can do a single xattrop after
    the entry is created on all the sinks.
    3) Missing entry self-heal uses one frame per sink to heal
    the file. This leads to multiple xattrops on the source subvol.
    That code is changed now to use one frame which will
    create the file on all subvols.

commit 7e1f8e3bac201f88e2d9ef62fc69a044716dfced
Author: Anand Avati <avati@gluster.com>
Date:   Fri Jan 13 13:27:15 2012 +0530

    core: GFID filehandle based backend and anonymous FDs
    
    1. What
    --------
    This change introduces an infrastructure change in the filesystem
    which lets filesystem operation address objects (inodes) just by its
    GFID. Thus far GFID has been a unique identifier of a user-visible
    inode. But in terms of addressability the only mechanism thus far has
    been the backend filesystem path, which could be derived from the
    GFID only if it was cached in the inode table along with the entire set
    of dentry ancestry leading up to the root.
    
    This change essentially decouples addressability from the namespace. It
    is no more necessary to be aware of the parent directory to address a
    file or directory.
    
    2. Why
    -------
    The biggest use case for such a feature is NFS for generating
    persistent filehandles. So far the technique for generating filehandles
    in NFS has been to encode path components so that the appropriate
    inode_t can be repopulated into the inode table by means of a recursive
    lookup of each component top-down.
    
    Another use case is the ability to perform more intelligent self-healing
    and rebalancing of inodes with hardlinks and also to detect renames.
    
    A derived feature from GFID filehandles is anonymous FDs. An anonymous FD
    is an internal USABLE "fd_t" which does not map to a user opened file
    descriptor or to an internal ->open()'d fd. The ability to address a file
    by the GFID eliminates the need to have a persistent ->open()'d fd for the
    purpose of avoiding the namespace. This improves NFS read/write performance
    significantly eliminating open/close calls and also fixes some of today's
    limitations (like keeping an FD open longer than necessary resulting
    in disk space leakage)
    
    3. How
    -------
    
    At each storage/posix translator level, every file is hardlinked inside
    a hidden .glusterfs directory (under the top level export) with the name
    as the ascii-encoded standard UUID format string. For reasons of performance
    and scalability there is a two-tier classification of those hardlinks
    under directories with the initial parts of the UUID string as the directory
    names.
    
    For directories (which cannot be hardlinked), the approach is to use a symlink
    which dereferences the parent GFID path along with basename of the directory.
    The parent GFID dereference will in turn be a dereference of the grandparent
    with the parent's basename, and so on recursively up to the root export.
    
    4. Development
    ---------------
    
    4a. To leverage the ability to address an inode by its GFID, the technique is
    to perform a "nameless lookup". This means, to populate a loc_t structure as:
    
    loc_t {
       pargfid: NULL
       parent: NULL
       name: NULL
       path: NULL
       gfid: GFID to be looked up [out parameter]
       inode: inode_new () result [in parameter]
    }
    
    and performing such lookup will return in its callback an inode_t
    populated with the right contexts and a struct iatt which can be
    used to perform an inode_link () on the inode (without a parent and
    basename). The inode will now be hashed and linked in the inode table
    and findable via inode_find().
    
    A fundamental change moving forward is that the primary fields in a
    loc_t structure are now going to be (pargfid, name) and (gfid) depending
    on the kind of FOP. So far path had been the primary field for operations.
    The remaining fields only serve as hints/helpers.
    
    4b. If read/write is to be performed on an inode_t, the approach so far
    has been to: fd_create(), STACK_WIND(open, fd), fd_bind (in callback) and
    then perform STACK_WIND(read, fd) etc. With anonymous fds now you can do
    fd_anonymous (inode), STACK_WIND (read, fd). This results in great boost
    in performance in the inbuilt NFS server.
    
    5. Misc
    -------
    The inode_ctx_put[2] has been renamed to inode_ctx_set[2] to be consistent
    with the rest of the codebase.

    don't try to get ngroups from /proc on non-Linux systems
    
    Emmanual Dreyfus abandoned his changes, seemingly because he couldn't
    get rfc.sh to correctly generate his changed patch set. Since Mac OS
    is an important port, I suggest we keep this change alive. (This
    change also works on the other BSDs too)
    
    Now with added Solaris support

    posix-acl: properly process umask in case client sent it
    
    FUSE used to interpret the umask itself. That was a bad idea, since
    there are cases where umask is not applied, such as when extended POSIX
    ACLs are present and default ACLs are set on parent directory.
    
    The FUSE bridge was changed to send original mode with umask (alongside
    masked mode, for compatibility). If that is the case, we decide whether
    to apply the umask or not in the posix-acl translator depending on
    whether a default umask is set, or not.
    
    The original, broken, behavior is preserved in following cases:
    * Unpatched client (not sending umask with original mode)
    * Unpatched server (not understanding umask with original mode)
    * Old FUSE on client side (FUSE < 7.12 or linux < 2.6.31)
      (can not find out the umask and original mode)

    fuse-bridge: preserve original mode and umask
    
    FUSE used to interpret the umask itself. That was a bad idea, since
    there are cases where umask is not applied, such as when extended POSIX
    ACLs are present and default ACLs are set on parent directory.
    
    Thus, FUSE was changed to pass umask to operation handler itself in case
    the fuse server is initialized with FUSE_DONT_MASK. In case FUSE
    supports it, gluster client sends mode unmasked and umask separately (
    masked mode is still sent, for compatibility with old servers).
    the mode as-is for compatibility with older clients.

    cluster/stripe: Fix block size reported in pathinfo xattr
    
    Block size (or stripe size) is reported when request is made
    for pathinfo xattr (trusted.glusterfs.pathinfo) for a striped
    volume. When the block size is changed, the new block size is
    reported for files created with older block size. This can be
    confusing ( or even erroneous ) for applications relying on
    pathinfo xattr to find chunks in backend.

    NOTE: This script *SHOULD BE RUN ONLY AFTER STOPPING A VOLUME*,

    protocol/server: Do connection cleanup if reply fails
    
    We observed that after the first connection cleanup happens on
    DISCONNECT the lock calls in transit are granted or added in
    blocked locks queue. These locks were never cleaned up after that
    because no unlock would come up on that connection. This would
    leave references on that transport so it would never be destroyed.
    Now, the connection cleanup happens whenever the reply
    submission fails.
    
    Also cleaned up the old code which is not used any more.

    fuse: bring in the reverse invalidation
    
    Thanks to Csaba Henk <csaba@gluster.com> for the patch
    
    Currently one can invalidate the inodes using 'setxattr()' with
    key 'inode-invalidate' (and any value). This can be further
    extended to do a purge of inode table itself.

    bz 3826, fix for parallel make in fedora build system
    
    builds of glusterfs in the fedora build system often fail due to a
    race condition between running yacc and starting to compile the y.tab.c
    produced by yacc
    
    We found that the previous fix would still occasionally trip the race
    condition. This revised patch changes the automake Makefile.am to generate
    the parser files without incurring the race condition. An extra dimension
    of the problem is that the tarball from
      http://download.gluster.com/pub/gluster/glusterfs/3.2/3.2.5/glusterfs-3.2.5.tar.gz
    contains files that you don't get when you clone from the git repo (e.g.
    libgluster/src/{graph.lex.c,y.tab.c}, and all the Makefile.in files) so
    build issues on fedora build systems do not manifest themselves on jenkins
    and vice versa.
    
    This works on jenkins, the fedora build system, and my f16 vm/guest
    machines. (Finding the right combination that works on all three was an
    exercise to say the least. I'm open to other suggestions for avoiding
    the race condition.)
    
    Run autogen.sh to (re)generate the Makefile.ins. Then run configure to
    produce all Makefiles, followed by `make -j X` where X>1

    Change the start/stop order of glusterd script at boot time.
    
    In cases of client and server sharing the same machine, mounting GlusterFS at
    boot time failed due to the start and stop order we use for glusterd. And people
    had to resort to the idea of adding mount command in rc.local.
    
    Currently the start and stop order at the boot time were 90 and 12, and netfs
    started before `glusterd' and failed to mount GlusterFS. By changing
    the rc order to 20 80 glusterd is started earlier than netfs, thus enabling

    cluster/distribute: Add support for 'min-free-inodes' on each distribute subvolume.
    
    This change is required as increasingly large number of small files
    would cause inodes to run out before they run out on available disk space.
    It is highly necessary to support algorithmic checking of inodes too
    just as we do for disk space.

    cli-cmd: call cli_cmd_unlock in the same function as cli_cmd_lock
    
    cli_cmd_submit calls cli_cmd_lock, but cli_cmd_unlock is done in
    cli_cmd_await_response. It is clearer to do the locking and unlocking in
    the same function.
    
    Only cli_cmd_submit seems to call cli_cmd_await_response, therefore
    moving the cli_cmd_unlock to cli_cmd_submit should be safe.

    stripe readv_cbk: Fix stat return values
    
    Workaround -
    If the read request, does not fall to the subvolume with the largest
    file size set, then we never return the correct size. This leads to
    clients seeing a truncated file error.
    
    The work around is to wipe stat being returned as part of read call.
    
    Problem -
    We were passing the stbuf returned by the first child/index, which
    can be different to the size/blocks returned by stat. This led to
    applications viewing the file as being truncated.
    
    The stbuf size needs to be the largest of all results, and blocks
    the aggregation from all subvolumes. (similar to stat)

    * Allow data self-heal to be started on all file types other than directories.
      During data self-heal, for special files just erase pending xattrs, if those

    changing of the volume types after volume is created.
    
    with this patch, one can do all the below operations:
    
    on a simple distribute volume 'test' with bricks A,B, add bricks C and D:
    
     bash# gluster volume add-brick test replica 2 C D
    
    now the volume 'test' becomes distribute-replicate, with pairs A-C, B-D.
    same holds good for stripe.
    
    and now, one can change the replica count 2 on volume 'test' to 4 like below:
    
     bash# gluster volume add-brick test replica 4 E F G H
    
    now, volume has 'replica' count 4, with pairs being 'A-C-E-F' and 'B-D-G-H'.
    
    after this, if user wants to reduce the replica count, he can do
    
     bash# gluster volume remove-brick test replica 3 C H # (one from each pair)
    
    This should work to reduce the replica count

    locks: perform inode_ref of pl_update_refkeeper outside locked region
    
    Performing inode_ref inside the critical section of pl_update_refkeeper
    (around pl_inode_t->mutex) causes a deadlock with inode_table_t->lock.
    The other thread (process state dump) holds the inode_table_t->lock first
    to loop over inodes and then while dumping an inode's lock context, tries
    to acquire pl_inode_t->mutex thereby completing the deadlock.
    
    The fix is to perform inode_ref outside the critical section in
    pl_update_refkeeper

    gluster volume geo-replication <master> <slave> log-rotate
    
    * Rotate log files for all session for master volume <master>
    gluster volume geo-replication <master> log-rotate

    glusterd: take off 'auto-commit' behavior of decommissioning
    
    currently if 'remove-brick <BRICKS> start' is given, after all
    the data is migrated, in the _cbk() function from rebalance
    complete we used to re-write the volume file without the bricks.
    But the flaw of this method is that, currently the _cbk() function
    is called on only the node on which rebalance actually happens,
    hence other nodes are not aware of this behavior. So, had to remove
    the 'auto-commit', instead we want the user to issue a command
    'remove-brick <Bricks> commit' (or 'force') explicitely to remove
    the bricks

    glusterd: cleanup unneeded volumes after peer detach
    
    Performs cleanup on the detached peer and in the cluster after a
    peer detach, and also adds a new check before starting detach.
    
    Cleanup -
     On the detached peer, cleanup removes the entries of those volumes
    on the peer that do not have all their bricks on it. This prevents
    these stale volumes from being added to a new cluster when peer is
    attached to one.
     In the cluster, all those volumes which have all their bricks on the
    detached peer are removed.
    
    Checks-
     Checks if all the peers in the cluster are online and connected,
     except the peer being detached, before starting detach. Using force
     will bypass this check and do detach.

    be harder to fix without real understanding of the code where they occur,

    cli : new volume statedump command
    
    Changes:
            1. Add a new 'volume statedump' command, that performs statedumps of
            all the bricks in the volume and saves them in a specified location.
            2. Add new server option 'server.statedump-path'.
            3. Remove multiple function definitions in glusterd.h
    
    Statedump Information:
    
    The 'volume statedump' command performs statedumps on all the bricks in
    a given volume. The syntax of the command is,
            gluster volume statedump <VOLNAME> [type]......
    
    Types include,
            * all
            * mem
            * iobuf
            * callpool
            * priv
            * fd
            * inode
    Defaults to 'all' when no type is specified.
    
    The statedump files are created by default in /tmp directory of the
    server on which the bricks are present.
    This path can be changed by setting the 'server.statedump-path' option.
    
    The statedump files will be named as,
            <brick-name>.<pid of brick process>.dump

    rpc: fix wrong wiping of state machine's state
    
    The macro __socket_proto_read() is used to read one sub-header in a fragment
    after another. It also has to 'get out' of the state machine's
    switch/case construct in two situations -
    
    a) finished reading the full header
    
    b) after a partial read, (and return in the same state at next pollin)
    
    The 'reset' of the state should happen only after a full read of the header
    and not if there was a partial read of the header.

    glusterd: cleanup of volinfo '*_count' definitions
    
    earlier, sub_count was having different meaning depending on the
    volume type.
    
    now, for replica and stripe count, one can directly access the
    'replica_count' or 'stripe_count' to get the corresponding
    value from the volume info. 'sub_count' is preserved as is for backward
    compatibility. there is a new variable 'dist_leaf_count' to get
    info about how many bricks are present in one distribute sub volume.

    rpc: No timeouts for lock fops.
    
    As of today, all fops bail out after 30 mins by default. This is not desirable
    with lock fops since it could be 'rightfully blocked' for a really long time.
    But the client would assume that the lock fop has 'expired' after 30 mins and
    clean up its references to the locks.  Later when the locks xlator decides to
    grant it, we are left with an orphan (stale) lock .
    
    This fix exempts lock fops from timeouts. Only on network disruptions both
    client and server decide to 'clean up' the locks held.

    geo-rep: implement IP address based access control
    
    - gsyncd gets allow-network tunable which is expected to
      hold a comma-separated list of IP network addresses
    - for IP addess matching, bring in ipaddr module from Google
      (http://code.google.com/p/ipaddr-py/, rev. trunk@225)
    
    This will let users control master's access to slave's volumes
    until we implement unprivileged geo-rep (delayed due to some
    technical issues). It's also needed for the completeness of
    our hardening efforts, as plain file slaves won't be able
    to work with an unprivileged gsyncd.

    gsyncd: implement restricted mode and utility dispatch
    
    With this change, the suggested way of setting up a geo-sync
    slave is to use an ssh key with gsyncd as a forced command
    (see sshd(8)), or set gsyncd as shell. This prevents the master
    in executing arbitrary commands on slave (a major security hole).
    
    Detailed list the changes:
    - All gsyncd invocations that are not done by glusterd are
      considered unsafe and then we operate in so-called "restricted mode"
      (see below)
    - if we are invoked on purpose (ie. it's not the case that sshd forced
      us to run as frontend of a remote-invoked command), we execute gsyncd.py
    - if invoked by sshd as frontend command, we check the remote command
      line and call the required utility if it's among the allowed ones
      (rsyncd and gsyncd)
    - with rsync, we check if invocation is server mode and some other
      sanity measures
    - with gsyncd, in restricted mode we enforce the usage of the glusterd
      provided config file, and in python, we enforce operation in
      server mode and some other sanity checks
    
    Impact on using geo-rep the old way: remote file slave now also
    requires a running glusterd (to pick up config from).
    
    Missing: we not implemented check of the rsync target path.
    The issue of master being able to modify arbitrary locations
    is planned to be mitigated by using geo-rep with an unprivileged
    user.

    Peer probe: Handle probe of friend with multiple hostname
    
    Currently, when a peer is probed with a different hostname already belonging
    to a cluster, a duplicate entry is created with uuid to set to 0.
    This leaves the peerinfo in a inconsistent state, and when a detach of
    this peer is issued, the correct entry gets removed.
    
    The fix is to identify a peer with a hostname not matching to the probed
    hostname and remove the incorrect entry.

    cluster/afr: Make local->child_up immutable
    
    Afr transaction performs lock, pre-op, op, post-op and unlock steps in that
    order. The child_up[] is overloaded with the information of where all
    the first two steps succeeded. This works perfectly fine for
    Transaction, but the locking/unlocking part of the code is re-used by
    data self-heal. In that each loop_frame does lock, rchecksum,
    read-from-source and write-to-sinks, unlock steps.
    
    Rchecksum fop assumes that the fop needs to happen on one source + all
    sinks and sets the call_count to that number. But if the lock step fails
    on any of the sinks it will mark the child_up of that child to 0, which
    will result in call_count mismatch and the frame will hang thinking that
    some more cbks need to come. When this happens loop_frame will never go
    to unlock step leading to hangs on that file.

    When run was doing a program invocation like "echo foo > foof",
    the file descriptor to foof was closed before stdout could be
    reopened to it.
    
    To fix this, we change the order of actions: first do redirections,
    then do the fd cleanup. This also simplifies code (as there are less
    fds which are exempt of the cleanup).

     - the earlier approach of creating quota related xattrs through
       side-effect of updating size and contribution values won't work,
       since when no contribution xattr is present, the updation process
       treats contribution value as zero and hence will be equal to size

    support for de-commissioning a node using 'remove-brick'
    
    to achieve this, we now create volume-file with
    'decommissioned-nodes' option in distribute volume, then just
    perform the rebalance set of operations (with 'force' flag set).
    
    now onwards, the 'remove-brick' (with 'start' option) operation tries
    to migrate data from removed bricks to existing bricks.
    
    'remove-brick' also supports similar options as of replace-brick.
    
    * (no options) -> works as 'force', will have the current behavior
             of remove-brick, ie., no data-migration, volume changes.
    
    * start  (starts remove-brick with data-migration/draining process,
              which takes care of migrating data and once complete, will
              commit the changes to volume file)
    * pause  (stop data migration, but keep the volume file intact with
              extra options whatever is set)
    * abort  (stop data-migration, and fall back to old configuration)
    * commit (if volume is stopped, commits the changes to volumefile)
    * force  (stops the data-migration and commits the changes to
              volume file)

    distribute rebalance: handle the open file migration
    
    Complexity involved: To migrate a file with open fd, we have to
    notify the other client process which has the open fd, and make
    sure the write()s happening on that fd is properly synced to the
    migrated file. Once the migration is complete, the client
    process which has open-fd should get notified and it should
    start performing all the operations on the new subvolume,
    instead of earlier cached volume.
    
    How to solve the notification part:
    
    We can overload the 'postbuf' attribute in the _cbk() function to
    understand if a file is 'under-migration' or 'migration-complete'
    state. (This will be something similar to deciding whether a file
    is DHT-linkfile by its 'mode').
    
    Overall change includes below mentioned major changes:
    
    1. dht_linkfile is decided by only 2 factors (mode(01000),
       xattr(trusted.glusterfs.dht.linkto)), instead of earlier
       3 factors (size==0)
    
    2. in linkfile self-heal part (in 'dht_lookup_everywhere_cbk()'),
       don't delete a linkfile if there is a open-fd on it. It means,
       there may be a migration in progress.
    
    3. if a file's revalidate fails with ENOENT, it may be due to file
       migration, and hence need a lookup_everywhere()
    
    4. There will be 2 phases of file-migration.
    
    -> Phase 1: Migration in progress
       * The source data file will have SGID and STICKY bit set in its mode.
       * The source data file will have a 'linkto' xattr pointing the
         destination.
       * Destination file will have mode set to '01000', and 'linkto' xattr
         set to itself.
    
    -> Phase 2: File migration Complete
       * The source data file will have mode '01000', and will be 'truncated'
         to size 0.
       * The destination file will have inherited mode from the source. (without
         sgid and sticky bit) and its 'linkto' attribute will be removed.
    
    4. Changes in distribute to work smoothly with a file which is in migration /
       got migrated.
    
    The 'fops' are divided into 3 categories, inode-read, inode-write and others.
    inode-read fops need to handle only 'phase 2' notification, where as, the
    inode-write fops need to handle both 'phase 1' and phase2. The inode-write
    operations will be done on source file, and if any of 'file-migration' procedures
    are detected in _cbk(), then the operations should be performed on the destination
    too.
    
    when a phase-2 is detected, then the inode-ctx itself should be changed to represent
    a new layout.
    
    With these changes, the open file migration will work smoothly with multiple clients.

    geo-rep: partial support for unprivileged gsyncd via mountbroker
    
    gsyncd:
      - mounting code is split to a direct and a mountbroker based backend
      - option gluster-command gone
      - new options: gluster-params, gluster-cli-options, mountbroker
      - mountbroker mount backend is used if either a mountbroker label
        is given through the mountbroker option, or if gsyncd is
        unprivileged; in this case the username is used as label
      - have gluster cli invocations log to stderr so that we don't
        hit a permission issue with the logfiles
    glusterd:
      - do gsyncd pre-config with new options
      - add option geo-replication-log-group, so if that specified
        geo-rep logfile directories are given to that group (and
        thus members of the given group can do logging there)
    
    This is just WIP as geo-rep relies on trusted extended attributes
    and those are not accessible for unprivileged users. Even if we
    solved this issue, glusterd security settings are too coarse,
    so that if we made it possible for an unprivileged gsyncd
    to operate, we would open up too far.

    glusterd / cli: mount-broker service
    
    Mountbroker is configured in glusterd volfile through a DSL
    which is restriced enough to be able to appear in the role
    of the value of a volfile knob.
    
    Basically the DSL describes set-theorical requirements
    against the option set which is sent by the cli (in the
    hope of getting a mount with these options).
    
    If the requirements meet and the volume id and the uid
    who is to "own" the mount can be unambigously deduced from
    the given request, glusterd does the mount with the given
    parameters.
    
    The use case of geo-replication is sugared by means of volume
    options which then generate a complete mount-broker option set.
    
    Demo:
    
    - add the following option to your glusterd volfile:
    
        option mountbroker-root /tmp/mbr
        option mountbroker.fool EQL(volfile-id=pop*|user-map-root=*|volfile-server=localhost)&MEET(user-map-root=john|user-map-root=jane)
    
    - before starting glusterd, create /tmp/mbr owned by root with mode 0755
    
    - with cli, do
    
       $ gluster system:: mount fool volfile-id=pop33 user-map-root=jane volfile-server=localhost
    
    - on succesful completion (volume pop33 exists and is started, jane is a valid username),
      the mount path will be echoed to you
    
    - you can get rid of the mount by
    
       $ gluster system:: umount <mount-path>

    cluster/afr: Make data selfheal trigger to be configurable.
    
    By default, lookup triggers data self-heal but that is not the preferred way
    of operating replicated volumes. We would like the data self heals to be
    triggered in open instead.
    Number of back-ground self-heals allowed is 16 and lookups block until
    self-heal is completed. We want to prevent blocking in fops. We can not make
    lookups independent of self-heal frames because when there are gfid conflicts
    the decision of which file is correct is determined in self-heal phase.
    So in afr, lookup self-heal is going to guarantee name space consistency
    and open/fd fops will take responsibility for data consistency, these
    are non blocking. The user needs to set the option cluster.data-self-heal
    "open" for this behavior.

    cluster/afr: eager locking of FD writes
    
    This patch is a change in the way write transactions hold a lock
    which optimizes the case of sequential writes from a single writer.
    
    Lock phase of a transaction has two sub-phases. First is an attempt
    to acquire locks in parallel by broadcasting non-blocking lock
    requests. If lock aquistion fails on any server, then the held locks
    are unlocked and revert to a blocking locked mode sequentially on
    one server after another.
    
    The change in this patch is to make the initial broadcasting lock
    request attempt to acquire lock on the entire file. If this fails,
    we revert back to the sequential "regional" blocking lock as before.
    
    In the case where such an "eager" lock is granted in the non-blocking
    phase, it gives rise to an opportunity for optimization. i.e, if
    the next write transaction on the same FD arrives before the unlock
    phase of the first transaction, it "takes over" the full file lock.
    Similarly if yet another transaction arrives before the unlock phase
    of the "optimized" transaction, that in turn "takes over" the lock
    as well. The actual unlock now happens at the end of the last
    "optimzed" transaction.
    
    Any operation which arrives before the unlock phase of the previous
    transaction is a potential candidate to become an "optimized"
    transaction. In cases where the previous transaction had aquired
    lock as a "regional" blocking lock, and the next transaction comes
    in before its unlock phase, then it would not be an "optimized"
    transaction.
    
    Implied assumption
    ------------------
    
    Since two or more transactions can now operate within the same
    large lock, there is a possibility that overlapping transactions
    can arrive at oppoosite orders on the servers. However in the
    larger picture this is not possible as write-behind already
    ensures that no two overlapping writes on an inode are in transit
    at the same time. Overlapping writes across clients are not a
    problem as they compete at locks anyways.
    
    Theoretical benefits and potential harms
    ----------------------------------------
    
    In case of a single writer: The benefits are large for sequential
    writes. In the best case the entire file write can happen with just
    one lock and unlock per server, provided writes are coming in fast
    enough and getting pipelined by write-behind soon enough (which is
    usually the case). If the writes are not coming in fast enough, then
    the optimization "kicks in" for only those subsets of writes which
    are close enough to get "piggybacked". For random writes the benefits
    are the same as well. In any case the overall performance is better
    than or equal to the performance without this optimization for a single
    writer.
    
    In case of multiple writers: When multiple writers are not writing
    concurrently, there is no negative performance impact. When multiple
    writers are writing concurrently to the same region, there is no
    negative impact either, as they were previously getting arbitrated
    at the locks translator too. In the case of multiple writers writing
    to different regions concurrently, there will be an increased number
    of "failovers" from failed parallel non-blocking to sequential blocking
    regional locks. This above "worst case" has a simple workaround that
    as soon as we detect > 1 open-fd-count in lookup xattr, we can disable
    this optimization on those fds.
    
    Beneficial side-effects
    -----------------------
    
    There is another similar optimization in AFR for changelogs which goes
    by the name of "changelog-piggybacking". That works in a similar way where
    pending flags get 'taken over' or 'piggybacked' by the next transaction
    if its 'pre-op' phase kicks in before the 'post-op' phase of the
    previous transaction. It has been observed that this changelog-piggybacking
    optimization gives a saving of about ~55% savings of xattr calls hitting
    the wire, measured across various types of network interfaces. The side
    effect of this eager-lock optimization is that it gives an almost 100%
    saving of xattr calls by making the optimistic-changelog work much more
    efficiently as it gives a wider overlap of the xattr phases of two
    consecutive transactions.

    nfs3: Resolve entry vs. hash conflict at same dir depth
    
    Intro Note
    ==========
    The current code in hard fh resolution takes the first-match approach, i.e.
    which ever dirent either matches the hash or matches the gfid first
    is the one chosen as the result for the next step of fh resolution. In
    the latter case, i.e., dirent matches the gfid, we the next step is to
    conclude the fh resolution by returning the entry whose gfid matched.
    In the former, i.e., the hash matches the dirent, we choose the hash-matching
    dirent as the next directory to descend into, for searching the file to be
    operated upon.
    
    Problem
    =======
    When performing hard fh resolution, there can be a situation where:
    
    o the hash of the primary entry,i.e. the entry we're looking for and the hash
    of another sibling directory, match. Note the use of "sibling", meaning both
    the primary entry and the hash matching one are in the same directory, i.e.,
    their filehandle.hashcount will be same.
    
    o the sibling directory is encountered first during the dir search.
    
    Because of the current code described in "Intro", we'll end up descending into
    the sibling directory even though the correct behaviour is to ignore this and
    wait till we encounter the primary entry in the same parent directory.
    
    Once we end up descending into this sibling directory, the directory depth
    validation check fails. The check fails because it notices that the resolution
    is attempting to open a directory that is deeper in the fs tree than the file
    we're looking for. When this check fails, we return an ESTALE. So basically, a
    false-positive results in an estale to Specsfs.
    
    This is not a theoretical situation. Me and Avati saw this on specsfs test
    where sfs created terabytes-sized file system for its tests. The number of
    files was so huge in a single directory that the hashes of two entries ended up
    colliding.

    modify to the way we used XDR definitions files (.x files)
    
    Earlier:
    step 1: copy the existing <xdr>.x files to /tmp
    step 2: generate '.[ch]' files using 'rpcgen <xdr>.x'
    step 3: check diff with the to the existing files, add only your part
            of changes back to the original file. (ignore other changes).
    step 4: there is another file to write wrapper functions to convert
            structures to/from XDR buffers, update it with your new structure.
    step 5: use these wrapper functions in the newly written procedures.
    step 6: commit :-|
    
    Now:
    step 1: update (mostly adding only) the <xdr>.x file
    step 2: run '<path-to-src>/extras/generate-xdr-files.sh <xdr>.x' command
    step 3: implement rpc procedure to handle the request/response.
    step 4: commit :-)

    cluster/afr: Prevent double big lock when data self-heal loops are not spawned
    
    The steps in normal data self heal:
    1) take big lock by self-heal frame. Get the xattrs/stat to decide
    source, sink information.
    2) spawn loop frames which perform self-heal by taking small locks on
    the file. Every time a new lock is taken and the old lock is released.
    3) Before releasing the final small lock a big lock is taken by the
    self-heal frame, and unlock on small-lock. Erasing of the pending xattrs
    happen then the big unlock happen and that is the end of the data self-heal.
    
    When a data self-heal is needed for a file and the fop
    that triggers the self-heal is open with O_TRUNC. Fuse sends open then
    an explicit truncate for this. Open triggers the self-heal but by the
    time it tries to spawn the loops the file size is truncated to 0, so
    no loops are formed.
    These are the steps:
    1) Take big lock by self-heal frame. Get the xattrs/stat to decide
    source, sink information.
    2) loop frames are not spawned. The big lock is not released.
    3) One more big lock is taken by the same self-heal frame, Erasing of
    the pending xattrs etc happen, now it does two big unlocks, but after
    the first unlock, the information on which the locks were performed is
    forgotten, so the next unlock becomes a no-op. So there is a stale big
    lock on that file preventing further writes.
    
    As a fix, if the loops are not spawned, use the previous big lock to
    perform the rest of the operations needed in completing the data
    self-heal. No need to have one more big lock.

    With this, we do now:
    
    - close uneeded files in children
    - watch childrens' stderr:
      - have a thread which collects childrens' stderr into a ring buffer
        (so that stderr pipe doesn't get stuffed)
      - on command failure show stderr
    - distinguish between rsync exit values, tolerate only partial errors
    - if connection is broken to slave, show ssh/slave gsycd's stderr

    posix-acl: disable permission checks for fd based ops
    
    If write calls are coming in through an fd with O_RDWR or O_WRONLY
    flag then a permission check is unnecessary. However writes from
    NFS ideally need a "stateless" check in each call and this results
    in a permission failure due to the read-only mode (disregarding the
    FD's writeability).
    
    For now it is acceptable to disable write checks as almost always
    the NFS client would already be doing such basic access control.
    Also because the previous access-control translator (prior to
    posix ACL introduction) too was permitting writes and reads
    unconditionally.
    
    In fact the Linux KNFS server too assumes the NFS client would have
    done the permission check.

    fuse-resolve: prevent linking of inodes of different inode-table
    
    This can happen in deep_resolve_cbk, which happens after a graph
    switch. Root cause was because the graph change happened while
    a FOP was in transit and by the time the call came back, the active
    translator of fuse is now changed.
    
    Fix is to make sure the resolve operation happens on a given
    inode table, instead of taking the latest graph of fuse for
    each operation

    Replace mktemp(3) with mkstemp(3).
    
    Man page states:
    Some implementations follow 4.3BSD and replace XXXXXX by the current process ID
    and a single letter, so that at most 26 different names can be returned.  Since
    on the one hand the names are easy to guess, and on the other hand there is a
    race between testing whether the name exists and opening the file, every use of
    mktemp() is a security risk. The race is avoided by mkstemp(3).

      (full stack strace is shown only at DEBUG loglevel)
    - common/well understood exceptions are mapped to "user-parsable" error logs

    performance/quick-read: Handle unwinding of frame corresponding to read fop properly, while validating cache.
    
      - there was a possibility of double unwind in case of errors.
      - use a new frame to do open in fd-based fops.
        In case of errors, qr_resume_pending_ops will be called to resume all the
        fops waiting on open. Hence if we use frame corresponding to fop (without
        creating a new one), there is a possibility of frame being freed by the
        time open would've returned to quick-read.

    Stripe_readdirp: Fix race in wind/unwind which led to crash
    
    Scenario - The race window exists when before we wind to a stat call
    in readdirp_cbk, whereas stats have returned to cbk. We would free up
    local, which leads to a crash.
    
    Fix - We assume all entries to be regular files, and set the wind_count
    as a multiple of entries * subvol (stat calls). When we encounter a non
    regular file, we decrement the windcount accordingly (subvol times). If
    the last entry happens to be a non-regular file, and all stat calls have
    wound back, we unwind from here itself.

    gerrit: some fixes for the rfc script
    
    In rebase_changes():
    
    - Using "--all" for git fetch is bogus: the scope of this quantification is not
      over the tracked refs of the upsteam repo (which we do want, but that kind
      of universal quantification is already implied by the notion of "tracking"),
      but over the set of all the registered remotes, which is an annoying side effect.
    
    - $EDITOR is weaker than the git configuration settings. For the purpose of the
      script, we need to override any kind of setting, and that can be done
      via $GIT_EDITOR.
    
    Cf. git-fetch(1), git-commit(1).

    Currently in pure replicate if the replica count is 4 and there are

    posix: perform readdir filling in locked region
    
    When two application threads share an open dir fd (DIR *) and issue
    readdirs, storage/posix will receive separate readdir fops in separate
    threads in parallel. This has two-fold issues
    
    1. In the following pair of operations -
    
       entry = readdir(dir)
           and
       strcpy (gf_dirent->name, entry->d_name)
    
       @entry is a static buffer in libc which can get reused by another thread
       to get filled with a longer name. This can cause the second operation
       to overflow the buffer as the allocation was for the smaller name.
    
    2. In the following pair of operations -
    
       seekdir (dir, offset)
          and
       entry = readdir(dir)
    
       If two threads are executing these sequence in parallel in separate
       threads, then one of them will end up reading wrong/unexpected entries.
    
    It would be sufficient to fix 1. by using readdir_r but that still keeps
    the second race open. Hence the patch moves all the set of operations to a
    locked region which solves both races.

    nfsrpc: Re-order NFS auth array contents
    
    Some NFS client implementations can default to AUTH_NULL given a certain order
    of auth_array in MOUNT reply. We re-order it here to make sure that such
    clients (Example - 2.6.26), do not have such security loop holes.

    server: Reassociating 'old' conn can lead to chaos.
    
    Since we moved to a single socket connection b/w client and server,
    inherting connection state is unnecessary and can sometimes be
    dangerous when clients reconnect even before the server detects
    a socket error on the old connection.
    
    Dirty detail: This reassociation results in 'ref count' not decreasing
    in tandem with the connection disconnects. This results in a resource

    distribute: handle 'fix.layout' key in setxattr() instead of getxattr()
    
    as 'fix.layout' command does changes to directory layout, its not a
    'read/get' type of operation, and hence as per the symantics, it suits
    setxattr() better
    
    also fix a memory leak in getxattr(), where 'local' was allocated twice

    PUMP: perform opendir on pump xlator instead of its child
    
    When replace-brick is performed, there is a high probability for the
    directories on the source brick to not have any pending entry xattrs.
    So for proper self-heal we need the force merge to kick in.
    If the opendir is performed on pump xlator directory is examined and
    if the entries on its children do not match then force merge is
    triggered, so missing entries will be created on the sink.
    Pending xattrs are set from source to sink on the files present on
    source in this process. So when the lookup happens the self-heal
    is triggered.
    
         Before this fix, the code is working because the self-heal source is
    decided based on what file is biggest in size which is a wrong and
    removed.

    quick-read: Fix dirname(3) usage
    
    glibc dirname() modify the string it is given and returns it.
    glusterfs takes this behavior for granted, and assume that if it
    gives a malloc'ed string to dirname(), then it can free()) the
    return value.
    
    Here is what SUSv2 says:
    http://opengroup.org/onlinepubs/007908799/xsh/dirname.html
    "The dirname() function may modify the string pointed to by path,
    and may return a pointer to static storage"
    
    At least NetBSD returns a static storage. glusterfs will return it to
    a calling function that has the responsability to free it, causing
    a SIGSEGV.

    libglusterfs: add 'run' sub-lib for safe and convenient invocation of external programs
    
    Summary:
    
    - arguments first collected, then the invocation happens with fork + exec
    - flexible specification of arguments (besides si{mp,ng}le argument
      addition, support for adding multiple of them at a time / specifying one with
      printf style formatting) [ ==> goodbye printf percentage soup when composing
      commands ]
    - single point of error check
    - simple command runs are done in just one line
    - support for redirection, popen(3) like functionality
    
    API is documented in details in libglusterfs/src/run.h

    upon daemonizing, wait on mtab update to terminate in parent
    
    This fixes the race in between the mtab update attempts of mount and umount
    when we do a lazy umount right after mounting, in order to hide the given fs
    instance; yet this way we still avoid the deadlock of the fs and mount which
    we can hit if we wait unconditionally for the mtab update to terminate (cf.
    bz #511).

    Introduce client-allow-insecure xlator-option.
    
    Allows glusterfs clients to bind to any port and does not restrict it
    to 1024.
    
    This is a xlator-option only, and is not supported in volume set cmd.
    The reason is, few clients may choose this, and few may not. Hence
    only supported as a xlator-option during mount time.
    
    For this to work with glusterfs, server.allow-insecure should be set
    to on

    cli: taking my revenge for forcing "geo-replication" into commandline
    
    Accept unambigous initial fragments of keywords, eg.
    
      gluster vol geo stat
    
    is recognized. Compared to readline integration:
    
    - no external dependency
    - works in shell too
    - works for inner keywords of operations
      (as in above example, or "vol crea <vol> repl 3 ...")
    - you save pressing tabs :)
    
    If not desired in customer builds, can be disabled by an #ifdef
    (not integrated into build system as of now); however, I think
    folks in house could like it.

    performance/write-behind: initialize lock in wb-file before wb-file is set in fd-ctx.
    
    - Consider a combination of fuse->quick-read->read-ahead->wb->client.
        quick-read can do open-behind (open is returned as success even
        before it is issued to backend) and hence the fd can already be
        in the list of open fds of the inode. A flush call on some other
        fd opened on the same inode, will result in ra_flush issuing flush
        calls to all the fds opened on the same inode. This can result in
        wb_flush trying to hold a lock on non-initialized lock there by causing
        memory corruption.

    glusterd / geo-rep: harvesting further benefits of static gsyncd pre-config
    
    - log-file does not need to be a reserved option anymore as we
      wouldn't overwrite the user setting
    - reimplement glusterd_gsync_get_param_file(): all use cases
      have now pre-configured values, so instead of putting together
      the needed pathname by ourselves, we can just get it from
      gsyncd config
      - refactor it to a common backend with glusterd_get_canon_url()

    glusterd / geo-rep: do all gsyncd pre-configuration in glusterd init
    
    This is made possible by gsyncd config templating, by which
    session specific settings can be expressed in a generic form.
    
    Benefits:
    - in glusterd we use only generic (rx pattern based) config settings
      so we don't violate users' freedom to make settigs for their sessions
    - don't have to invoke gsyncd in excess to prepare a session
    - we can pre-configure slave side too (relying on the templates and
      gsyncd service auto-discovery)
    - much leaner, much more expressive code

    syncdaemon: implement template substitutions for config values
    
    So, for example, a log file setting of
    
      /var/log/${mastervol}/${eSlave}.log
    
    will be substituted with the volume name of the master and the
    canonicalized-escaped name of the slave for each master-slave pair.
    
    As template expanders, beyond the various forms and derivatives
    of master and slave, the following are also available:
     - gsyncd tunables (set in command line or in config)
     - for regexp sections, regexp group captures can be accessed
       via "match<i>_<n>", where i=1,2 corresponds to the i-th peer-rx
       in the section title and n=1,... to the n-th capture.
    
    This will enable us to have a static configuration (not having to
    add new entries on each gsyncd start).

    features/marker-quota: reduce contributions to parents during unlink only if it is the last link.
    
    - since we are not having different contributions for different (parent, name)
        pairs, but only for different parents, links present in the same directory
        will have only one contribution representing all of them. Hence parents will
        not be updated for each link call and parents account for just file-size
        instead of (numlinks * filesize). However this patch will cause issues
        for links present accross directories, as only one of their contributions
        is subtracted when all of them removed (Here all the links are accounted
        in their parents, thereby total size accounted is [numlinks * filesize]).

    cli: join value arguments of "gsync config-set" with spaces
    
    When a given gsync tunable is supposed to hold a command (which
    can take options), it's quite possible that it spaces in its value.
    Try to approximate this situation by joining the leftover arguments.

    declare favorite child as int instead of unsigned int
    
    In afr_private_t structure favorite child is declared as unsigned int.
    In init function of afr we set favorite child to -1, if that option is
    not found in volfile. But favorite child value will be set to a huge
    value instead of -1 since it is an unsigned int and in statedump file
    favorite child value is displayed as a huge value instead of -1.

    syncdaemon: fix setting None as new master
    
    We checked for the event of a new master being adopted by:
    - checking for state change in list of masters
    - checking if our chosen master is a foreign one
    and if these held, then wrote out the actually available master to config
    
    However this was flaky: if
    (1) native master changed
    (2) there was already a foreign master adopted
    (3) actually the master was not available
    then we wrote out the None to config.
    
    This could occur if:
    - on syncd startup, native master just changes from None to the volume native
      [implies (1)]
    - foreign master adopted from earlier run via config [implies (2)]
    - actually foreign master was not available [implies (3)]

commit ef19a8ba4c0628566c01ebd247869797a7ba5dde
Author: Raghavendra G <raghavendra@gluster.com>
Date:   Sun Apr 10 10:55:08 2011 +0000

    features/quota: Fix race-condition while resuming stub.
    
    - call-stub is resumed in fops calling quota_check_limit and quota_check_limit
        when validate_count is zero, indicating no pending validates. During
        validates, validate_count was decremented in quota_validate_cbk, but check
        for validate_count being zero was done in quota_check_limit (which is
        called by quota_validate_cbk). Hence there is a time window b/w decrementing
        validate_count in quota_validate_cbk and checking whether
        validate_count is zero in quota_check_limit, during which if the
        control is passed to code in fop checking for validate_count being zero,
        same stub will be resumed twice - once in fop and once in quota_check_limit.

    mgmt/glusterd: Fix op_ctx issue with replace brick
    
    Replace brick recognizes command originator by the presence of op_ctx.
    Brick op uses the op_ctx to collect the brick response on all the
    machines in cluster. This patch satisfies both these assumptions to
    make glusterd functional in replace-brick.
    This is a hack for 3.2.0. Need to Fix the assumptions in later release.

    mismatch for the same file, which is harder to find through basic
    debugging/logging of current codebase.

Author: Csaba Henk <csaba@gluster.com>
Date:   Sat Apr 2 19:40:47 2011 +0000

    syncdaemon: give some refactoring to cascading code
    
    - expiry check of foreign volinfo moved back to GLUSTERServer,
      so that under the hood we can removexattr the expired ones;
      a nice side-effect is that we can use the same dict layout
      for foreign and native volinfo (ie., foreign needs no
      timeout field)
    - get_volinfo() is renamed to get_sys_volinfo() and most of the logic
      is stripped off of it (what remained there is the check
      against foreign master ambiguity)
    - volinfo transition logic is cut out to an almost purely functional
      static method (only impurity is the exeption raised upon
      forbidden volinfo change)
    - ping renamed to keep-alive, as something called "ping" is
      not supposed to have payload (yeah, keep-alive is a bit fishy
      on this front too, but could not come up with better...)

    nfs: capture attrs of create request in cs->stbuf for later use
    
    when attrs coming in as part of create request contain modes other
    than mode, they were getting discarded previously and a setattr
    was getting performed on a 0-filled iatt structure. This would
    result in EPERM at the access control translator as non-root users
    cannot chown a file to uid 0.
    
    Not seen with Linux NFS client as it (very likely) relies upon
    auth-unix to set the ownership of the file or sends an explicit
    setattr after the create.

    nfs3.c/nfs3_create_common:
    
    The if condition checks for create mode being EXCLUSIVE. However, when
    create mode is EXCLUSIVE, this function never gets called (nfs3_create_exclusive is
    called). Also, instead of checking, it actually sets the value of createmode (= instead of ==).

    Prevent deadlock in io-stats list management of top.
    
    Senario: thread t1 has lock on the queue, and waits on the element lock to remove
    it and unref it. Thread t2 has a lock on the element being removed from the queue,
    but waiting on the queue on the list to update it.
    
    The fix is to move list management to outside of the lock. Additonal to this change
    is adding locks to ios_stat_ref

commit 4aeaa48108d924ea67d77fedfadb7d96a13712dd
Author: Raghavendra G <raghavendra@gluster.com>
Date:   Wed Mar 16 09:40:43 2011 +0000

    performance/quick-read: propagate errors during open back to actual fops.
    
    - If open fails and there are any other fops waiting on that open, those fops
        should also unwind with appropriate errors. Before this patch, irrespective
        of success/failure of open, fops waiting on it were stack_wound and since
        fd was invalid, they would fail with EBADFD errors. Due to this
        actual error would've got masked by EBADFD.

    log will be done when the memory allocation fails, hence in code,
    no explicit logs required for memory allocation failures.
    
    also, if there are logs before actually doing a log_init(), they will
    be logged in 'stderr'.

        and handling of a send/recv completion on the same qp for some previous
        read/write - in send/recv_completion_process. Hence we should be checking

    Solaris xattr support for symlink and special files.
    
    Since glusterfs uses xattr for storing gfid, and xattr support for
    symlinks and special files does not exist in solaris. The work around
    is provided by creating hidden files under export directory on solaris
    hosts only. the hidden files ares maintained in .glusterfs_xattr_inode directory,
    and all xattr ops on symlink and special files are redirected to respective
    inodes.
    
    All dir entries with name starting as .glusterfs (GF_HIDDEN_PATH) will
    not be shown in readdir ops.

    check the op_ret for less than zero in sp_create_cbk since posix can send negative values other than -1
    
    posix can send -ve values other than -1 in create:
    
    op_ret = setgid_override (this, real_path, &gid);
    
            if (op_ret < 0) {
                    goto out;
            }
    
    In stat-prefetch we check op_ret only for -1 which results in function
    proceeding and op_ret may become 0 due to other function calls in
    sp_create_cbk, hence crashes in fuse.

        winding calls to multiple children. Since iobrefs can hold only limited

    If the BUF argument is NULL, then on solaris the size argument has to be passed.
    On linux, if the size argument passed is 0, then it dynmically allocates a buffer
     of the required size. The fix is to pass PATH_MAX as the size for consistency.

    Note, if an ip octet range exceeds 255, though this fails as a valid

    cluster/afr: stop spawning self-heal loops when the self-heal fails
    
    With the current model of self-heal, any loop wont resume if a
    self-heal failure happens. I have added the fix to stop spawning the
    initial loops on self-heal failure.
    Fixed the invalid read shown in valgrind in diff-self-heal.

    syncdaemon: change pidfile handling approach
    
    Signal handling of the python interpreter is a bit messy, so we cannot
    rely on executing a final clause upon termination. Switch over fcntl
    lock based pidfile handling which can provide reliable info about status
    of the process. (Due to aforementioned reason, pidfile as such is not
    guaranteed to be cleaned up, but lock acquisition is a reliable measure.)

commit 07402f590e12b097e8267e924e0ae69d9b8964fb
Author: Csaba Henk <csaba@gluster.com>
Date:   Mon Feb 7 20:42:24 2011 +0000

    syncdaemon: config revamp #3: implement command line get/set/del interface to configuration
    
    The INI style config file has following type of sections:
    
    - [global]
    - [peers <local>]
    - [peers <local> <remote>]
    
    Option dispatch to sections is derived from command line (ie., [global]
    if no arg given, [peers <local>] with <local> being the only arg,
    [peers <local> <remote>] if <local> and <remote> args are provided).
    So this all happens under the hood, gsyncd users need not to specify
    sections.
    
    New command line options:
    
    - query options:
      --config-get-all
      --config-get OPT
    - modify options:
      --config-set OPT VAL
      --config-del OPT

    protocol/client: decrement reopen fd count in cases of re-open errors
    
    In post-client-handshake client tries to re-open files, dirs, but if those
    files/dirs are already deleted when the brick is down the reopens
    won't even get triggered. In those cases the re-open fd count needs to
    be decremented to make sure the child up is triggered.
    I have also made similar changes in all the error cases of re-open/re-open-dir
    cbks. Lock recovery is already handling all these errors.

    Fuse cant send aux gids. So access-control checks treat
    non-primary-group membership of user as "other". So skip
    access-control checks if the call is from fuse. We added a hack to
    treat all calls with pid set to 1 as calls from nfs. So for calls with pid
    not 1 we skip the access-control checks on all fops.

commit 89cbbee063243d84dc64b15b2e2f403be1ca226b
Author: Shehjar Tikoo <shehjart@gluster.com>
Date:   Tue Jan 11 01:40:16 2011 +0000

    nfs: Introduce tunable for memory consumption
    
    NFS has used a common define called the mem-factor to determine
    how much memory is allocated for the following items:
    
    o inode table
    o local structures used by nfs for storing fop state
    o local structures used by nfs3 for storing nfs op state
    
    These are all allocated through the mem-pool. The factor is multiplied by
    a multiple that is specific to each data structure. For eg.
    
    define GF_NFS_CONCURRENT_OPS_MULT     15
    define GF_NFS_INODE_LRU_MULT          6000
    
    The first value is used for allocating a mem-pool for storing
    state for each fop or nfs op that is currently being handled. Knowing that linux
    allows at most 128 in-flight requests, this multiple combined with the default
    mem-factor of 15 gives us 225 slots in the mem-pool for the local structures.
    
    Similarly, 6000*15 gives us a space of 90k inodes in the lru.
    
    That means, increasing the common mem-factor will allow increasing the perf
    under some conditions. This patch introduces the mem-factor as a configurable
    option.

    Enable exporting directories as separate exports. Even though the directories
    wont show up in showmount output, they'll still be mount'able.
    
    The new option:
    
            nfs.export-dirs <on|off>
    
    is enabled by default so that users dont have to wait till this option
    is incorporated into the gluster command line.

    f5afcc47f9f00472d6c2b3f48127e02332cd457a
    
    but reverted because the patch was buggy and caused a seg-fault
    due to extra inode_unrefs.
    
    It fixes that extra inode_unref and cleans up the revalidation logic.

    inode: catch loop formation during inode_link() and fail linking
    
    - explores all parent branches
    - performs loop formation check only if the operation is resulting in relinking
      of an inode already existing in the table

    GF_EVENT_CHILD_CONNECTING is sent as a status from underlying subvolumes

    nfs: opendir/closedir for every readdir
    
    Revert "nfs3: Unref & unbind dir fd with inode lock on EOF"
    
    This reverts commit 4e6fb304ce41acbaf7c9ba67c06bf443e65082e8.
    
    The above commit (which unbinds fds at EOF) does not fix the original
    bug (1619) because a readdir from a second app could have already
    started before the readdir_cbk of the first app's readdir reaches
    NFS code. Hence the race still exists.
    
    Performing extra unrefs when EOF is received is not a reliable way
    of detecting that a client has performed a closedir (and to close
    the fd ourselves). Neither is interpreting a 0 cookies a new opendir.
    Clients can always use telldir/seekdir and hit EOFs twice.
    
    Due to the way NFS3 protocol is designed, it is just not possible
    for the server to reliably detect opendirs/closedirs performed by
    the client and map the corresponding readdirs to the same dir fd
    on the server side.
    
    The only reliable way of fixing this is to perform opendir/closedir
    at the cost of performance. Any optimization towards keeping dir fds
    open attempting to map them with application's opendir/closedir will
    either result in fd leaks or extra fd unrefs.

    replicate: optimistic changelog
    
    The standard way of maintaining changelog in replicate has been to
    write out pending flags and to unset the pending flag post the
    actual operation.
    
    This new optimization kicks in only when all subvolumes are up.
    
    The optimization is that, during pre-op, no changelog is written for
    METADATA and ENTRY/RENAME operations. If during the operation nothing
    failed, no changelog is updated in post-op either. If however,
    something does fail during an operation, then, pending flags get
    written during post op pointing only towards the failed nodes.
    
    DATA transactions continue to work the way they are.
    
    If one subvolume is down, pending flags are written in pre-op changelog
    itself as before.
    
    The impact of this optimization is only in the case when both servers
    die or the client dies while the 'FOP' stage of the transaction is
    in progress. By nature of METADATA and ENTRY operations, detecting a
    mismatch later is not dependent on the presence of changelog. Changelog
    only determines the direction in which self-heal happens for these types
    of transactions. For the direction too this optimization does not have
    a major impact because in the cases of failure (both servers dieing or
    client dieing) the final state (direction of self-heal) would be
    arbitrary anyways as the syscall wouldn't have completed.

    nfs: Introduce rpc.register-with-portmap to disable portmap registration
    
    For systems that need to run multiple nfs servers, we need to prevent
    more than one from registering with portmap service. Use this option
    to turn off portmap registration for Gluster NFS.
    
    Portmap registration is on by default.

    Now the code has lived up to the glorious state of not relying
    on getting the FLUSH whenever a file is released. So we don't need
    to forge one in release for the cases when the kernel doesn't send
    it.

    - If fragcurrent is initialized in the same state which reads payload data,
       there is a possibility of it getting reset during partial reads from socket.
       Hence it should be initialized just before entering the state which reads

    nfs: avoid assignment of structure pointer into serialized buffer
    
    With the introduction of variable sized file handle feature in NFS,
    on-wire lengths of file handles can be lesser than file handle structure
    of code. Direct pointer assignment into the offsetted buffer and
    dereference and result in reads beyond the end of buffer and crashes.

commit d1f938c16e309431382ab9aaa32d50bf0ccd3260
Author: Raghavendra G <raghavendra@gluster.com>
Date:   Fri Oct 8 20:21:59 2010 +0000

    rpc-transport/rdma: fix the bug which was causing an ioq-entry being mem_put twice.
    
    - in case of failure to send message, ioq-entry would be freed, but it used to
        get added to the ioq-list. Failure in sending a message (for reasons
        other than insufficient quota), would result in transport being
        disconnected. In the process of handling pollerr, when ioq-list is flushed,
        the same ioq-entry which would've already been freed, would be freed for
        second time.
      - this patch also fixes spurious disconnects happening when quota was not
        available while sending a request.

    volgen: reimplement volgen
    
    Generating a volfile occurs in two steps:
    - Build a graph (ie, glusterfs_graph_t instance) by graph manipulation
      primitives
    - Write out the graph to a file by the the graph printing API.
    
    Graph builder routines can optionally make use of a "modifier dict",
    which can contain overrides wrt. volume options. This can be used
    for a "dry-run" graph generation.

    step 1: fix layout (quick pass, so the newly added brick can
            participate in distribute's entry creations)
    
    step 2: migrate data (do the actual rebalance)
    
    Its advised to run rebalance after add-brick, and let it complete
    at-least 'step 1', so things will be smooth with distribute.

    rpc/rpc-transport: fix frame-loss during rdma-reads.
    
    - total no of rdma reads in progress was tracked using refcount of post
        (refcount = total rdma reads + 1). However doing rdma_post_unref _after_
        rdma_do_reads, can result in race condition between execution of
        rdma_post_unref and procedure handling rdma read completion. This makes
        it impossible to find out whether the current rdma read was the last
        rdma-read being done in procedure handling rdma read-completion.
        The fix to this should either do rdma_post_unref before posting an rdma
        read or use another variable to track the number of rdma-reads.
        This patch implements second method.

    distribute: bring in feature to fix the layout of root inode
    
    * If the errno is ESTALE for root, fuse doesn't send fresh lookup on
      the path (it does for all other inodes). Earlier layout mismatch for
      root never used to happen inside codebase, and if noticed, it was
      serious issue.
    
      Now with DVM, after a add-brick or a remove-brick, layout can be
      changed even for 'root' inode. Needed to fix this issue inside
      distribute itself, instead of fuse sending 'fresh' lookup on root.

    nfs, nfs3: Base volume access on CHILD-UP-DOWN event
    
    Overall, the aim of this patch is to change the result of an nfs
    op depending on whether the underlying volume is up or down
    as notified by CHILD_UP and CHILD_DOWN events.
    
    This patch contains three intertwined changes:
    o Only when the lookup on the root of a volume is successful does gnfs now
    export the subvolume. Till now the result of the lookup was not used to
    determine whether we should export that volume. Not accounting for root lookup
    failure resulted in ESTALEs on first access because some children of distribute
    were down at the time of the root lookup.
    
    o Only when lookups on all the subvolumes have succeeded are
    these exports enabled through NFS.
    
    o When a child of say distribute goes down, on CHILD_DOWN event nfs will
    ignore all incoming requests from the client because ignoring these
    will prevent ESTALEs for those requests and in the hope that ignoring the
    requests will make the client retransmit. There are risks in this approach
    absent the DRC but we're willing to live with that for now.
    When a child goes down, the mount exports list will continue to show it
    but mount requests will be denied.

    libglusterfs: handle failure properly in gf_system()
    
    - Child must be terminated if execve(2) fails, otherwise it will deadlock
      parent
    - Status, as of given by waitpid(2), is aggregated data, should not be
      returned as is. In fact, there is not much point in threading up the
      exitvalue: callers usually return gf_system result as is, and according
      to glusterfs conventions, they should return -1 on failure. Therefore
      now we check only for success/fail, and return 0/-1.

    portmap: add support for registering multiple bricks on one port
    
    Rationale: if a brick serves multiple volumes, all of them need
    to be registered for the port the brick server listens on.
    
    Implementation: to register volumes "foo" and "bar" for port 6543,
    you have to send a SIGNUP for brick: "foo bar", port: 6543.
    Upon a pmap lookup, we match the search term to
    whitespace tokenized bricknames on server side.

    rpc-clnt: fix memory corruption happening while encoding auth data.
    
    - buffer containing authdata pointed by rpc-request was allocated on stack of
       procedure rpc_clnt_fill_request, but was being used as source for xdr-encoding
       in rpc_clnt_record_build_record. Hence by the time auth-data is being copied
       during encoding of request, it might've been freed and hence contain garbage.

commit 2822157056d8347518f7e1b8bf9ee04bea7286ae
Author: Anand Avati <avati@gluster.com>
Date:   Fri Sep 3 13:58:11 2010 +0000

    gfid: introduce uuid based handles for inodes
    
    gfid represents a gluter file id. This is a universally unique id
    assigned to a logical inode, independent of the inode numbers
    assigned by the various backend filesystems to that file/directory.
    The gfid of a file/directory will be the same on servers depending
    on the cluster translator in picture.
    
      The same gfid can be used as a handle across layers of various
    translators and across servers and clients. This was not the case
    previously as the cluster translators would pick the backend inode
    number from one of the servers and convert that into a logical
    inode number by performing some mathematical transforms.
    
      This new technique of addressing inodes also makes dynamic volume
    management have a more robust implementation as the file handles
    remain the same on all versions of the graphs, and allows for
    seamless NFS daemon restarts as well.
    
      This change makes way for server originating communication which
    was not possible earlier as the servers did not have any reliable
    way of addressing client side inodes at all. gfid solves this problem
    by preserving the same uuid as the handle on all the servers and
    across all clients

    fuse: introduce pre-test micro-framework, check for execve-over-direct-IO
    
    The presence of some potential FUSE features in the actual kernel-side FUSE
    implementation we run on is not always straightforward. More precisely, it is
    straightforward only if there is a dedicated feature flag or protocol revision
    number. In the other cases we are left to clumsy and platform specific hacks
    which wire in 3rd-party software revision numbers into our source... at least,
    if we insist on sticking to (the otherwise venerable) KISS principle.
    
    However, here we go for another route, loosely inspired by the way autotools
    provide an abstraction layer for our build system over the gory details of
    platform specific build environments.
    
    At start time, we use a preliminary set of FUSE operations which overlay the
    standard ones such that apart from the "usual stuff", they also present some
    synthetic files to the FUSE client (kernel). Then we spawn some test programs
    which perform the needed tests on these synthetic files to evaulate the FUSE
    implementation in terms of the features in question. According to the result
    of the test programs, we set the respective parameters of the fuse xlator;
    when the testing phase is over, the FUSE operation set is replaced by the
    standard one.
    
    As of now, we use this approach to test whether execve(2) works with
    direct I/O. If yes, and if glusterfs is used with --enable-direct-io-mode,
    then we let direct I/O for files opened for reading; if no, then we restrict
    direct I/O only to writing files.

    rpc: changes to glusterfs programs that can take an optional payload argument.
    
    - The existing interface required the transport to separate the procedure
        header and procedure payload into two different buffers. Making this
        separation can prove cumbersome for transports like rdma wherein the header
        and payload can be received in a single buffer (For eg., header and payload
        of write fop sent as inline msg using rdma-send). This patch delegates the
        responsiblity of separating out header and payload to programs.

    syncop: initial implementation
    
    Resending Avati's syncop patch with a few bug fixes.
    
    (please do not skip the IMPORTANT NOTES section)
    
    * Framework for SYNChronous OPerations
    --------------------------------------
    
    This patch provides a framework for performing synchronous operations
    over the underlying actual asynchronous GlusterFS FOPS.
    
    * Use cases
    -----------
    
    1. Convenient implementation of crawler thread in replicate/pump
    
    2. Convenient implementation of high level control flow in DVM
    
    * Background
    ------------
    
    All (almost) threads in GlusterFS are hosts for executing aysnchronous
    file operations using the STACK_WIND and STACK_UNWIND primitives - as calls
    and callbacks.
    
    While the STACK_WIND and STACK_UNWIND macros provide high control for
    efficiently implementing file operations in a clustered/parallel environment,
    there are tasks where the nature of the task itself is sequential and
    the execution performance of the task is not critical. In these cases the
    complexity to implement the task with STACK_WIND/STACK_UNWIND based operations
    as calls and callbacks is an overkill.
    
    * Introduction
    ---------------
    
    syncop: are wrappers around the STACK_WIND/STACK_UNWIND based asynchronous fops.
    
    synctask: a sequential task (a C function) which uses syncops.
    
    syncenv: an environement to schedule and execute synctasks.
    
    The synchronicity is implemented via ucontext.h based continuations.
    
    Execution of synchronous tasks is possible only in a synchronous environment.
    Therefore, the first step  is to create such an environment -
    
            struct syncenv *env = syncenv_new (0);
    
    This creates a synchronous environment, with a thread (scheduler) to host the
    synchronous tasks. Creation of this environment is generally to be done at the
    time of process initialization. Next is to spawn a synchronous task in this
    environment -
    
            int slow_self_heal (void *data);
            int completion_func (int ret, void *data);
    
            ret = synctask_new (env, slow_self_heal, completion_func, data);
    
    Here slow_self_heal is a task which is implemented using synchronous operations.
    When slow_self_heal() completes, completion_func() is called with the first
    parameter as the return value of slow_self_heal(). Both these functions get
    the @data argument as the same value passed to synctask_new().
    
            int
            slow_self_heal (void *data)
            {
                xlator_t *child = FIRST_CHILD (THIS);
                fd_t     *dir = NULL;
    
                ...
    
                dir = syncop_opendir (child, loc);
                entry = syncop_readdir (dir);
    
                ...
    
                return ret;
            }
    
    * IMPORTANT NOTES
    -----------------
    
    - calling syncops in code executing outside the synchronous environment will
      very likely cause and undesired blocking of the executing thread leading to
      deadlocks!!
      The synchronous environment is a special thread where such sleeps are safe,
      and these sleeps result in the scheduler to 'swap in' other synctasks.
    
    - syncops can put the task to sleep. DO NOT issue syncops while holding mutexes.
      This is very similar to the blunder of holding a mutex and doing STACK_WIND.
    
    - It works best when synctasks use only syncops. If a call_frame is created and
      STACK_WIND'ed, the callback would very likely happen in a thread outside the
      synchronous enviroment, at an undefined time - as expected. So note that the
      synchronous environment does not tame the notorious behaviour of STACK_WIND.

    changes to rpc
    
    - use mem-pool for requests and saved_frames.
      - preserve the rpc_req structure till rpc invokes program's reply.
        This will enable us to store transport specific data that has to
        last till reply has come (eg., memory regions of chunk lists in
        case of rdma).

        rsppayload_vector. The buffers pointed by these vectors will be
        from iobufs and these iobufs are added to an iobref which should
        also be passed as an arguement to rpc_clnt_submit.

    nfs3: NULL fdentry check before removing from fdcache
    
    Suppose a file name 1 is created and some data is written to it. After this
    another 512 files are newly created and written to. When the the 513th file is
    created and an fd_t opened for it, it results in 1's fd_t being replaced in the
    fd-lru with 513th file's fd_t. This is the correct behaviour resulting in all
    refs getting unref from the fd_t of 1 and the fd and all related state being
    freed.
    
    But, in some workloads, some refs are still pending even after the fd_t is
    removed from LRU, resulting in the fd still being bound to the inode. In
    nfs3svc_remove_cbk, while removing the inode state, we also ensure that any
    fd_ts in the cache for this inode are also removed. While removing the fd_t,
    this situation where the fd_t has replaced with another, even while a ref
    remains on the fd_t, results in a crash in the fdcache_remove path in
    nfs3svc_remove_cbk. This happens because the fd_ctx_get results in a NULL value
    because the ctx was already deleted when this fd_t was removed from fd-lru
    earlier. This patch fixes the crash by introducing a NULL check.

    replicate: Set setxattr wait-count to child-count to avoid race
    
    A race is seen during a compilebench load against NFS where a NFSv3 MKDIR is
    immediately followed by a LOOKUP on the new directory. By the time this lookup
    comes in, the setxattr issued by distribute for the mkdir has not returned yet
    from all the replicas. Since replicate returns a reply for setxattr after
    receiving reply only from one subvol, the MKDIR is unwound from distribute.
    
    When the LOOKUP is received at distribute, the setxattr has still not completed
    at the second replica, whereas that is where the lookup is sent by replicate.
    Finding that the xattr is missing from the dir, distribute returns ESTALE to
    NFS, which return NFS3ERR_STALE to nfs client.
    
    This patch changes replicate setxattr behaviour by forcing replicate to wait for all
    children rather than one to call back before unwinding the stack.

commit 654a720eed0bc5faaeeaa4eb34f1cfc10df76230

    proper way to do defrag of a mountpoint
    
    Usage: "glusterfs-defrag <MOUNTPOINT>"
    
    there are new features added to distribute with this patch:
    
    * bash# getfattr -n trusted.distribute.linkinfo <file>
      Gives output in the format "<hostname>:<directory>", if there is a
      linkfile present, where hostname is server, directory is backend
      directory where the actual linkfile is present.
    
    * bash# getfattr -n trusted.glusterfs.pathinfo <path>
      Gives layout information if directory, and info about actual
      location of file in backend servers, in the form of
      'hostname:directory'. (TODO: should extend it to all xlators)
    
    * bash# getfattr -n trusted.distribute.fix.layout <path>
      scales out the directory layout in distribute, so when new
      servers are added, layouts are fixed to include them.
    
    * removed 'scale-n-defrag.sh' as its no more required.
    
    * changed 'defrag.sh' to have a feature to specify target bricks,
      so defrag happens to only those nodes. moved the file to
      'glusterfs-defrag', which now gets installed to '${prefix}/bin'
    
    * storage/posix:
      takes new option 'hostname' so it can resolve to same hostname
      given during 'gluster volume create'.
      with 'trusted.glusterfs.pathinfo' posix returns the value in
      'hostname:real_path' format.

    nfs: Support directory level exports
    
    nfsx has followed traditional approach of exporting whole volumes
    as NFS exports. The Platform requires and some users have approached us for
    introducing exports of only specific directories instead of full Gluster
    volumes. This commit introduces this support through two nfsx options:
    
    Option 1:
    
    =========
    option nfs3.<volume-name>.export-dir <subdir1-in-vol>,<subdir2-in-vol>,..<subdirN-in-vol>
    
    export-dir will allow the export of a particular dir as a single export
    by itself. For eg.:
    
    volume posix
            type storage/posix
            option directory /export/
    end-volume
    
    volume posix-ac
            type features/access-control
            subvolumes posix
    end-volume
    
    volume nfs
            type nfs/server
            subvolumes posix-ac
            option rpc-auth.addr.allow *
            option nfs3.posix-ac.export-dir /homes/shehjart
    end-volume
    
    A comma separate list of sub-directories will set up those dirs as separated exports.
    At the nfs client, the mount command will be:
    
    $ mount <nfsserver>:/posix-ac/homes/shehjart /mnt
    
    Option 2:
    =========
    option nfs3.<volume-name>.export-volumes <on|off>
    
    There can be situations where users only want the directory level
    exports and require that volume exports be completely disabled. The
    above option allows us to do this. By default, volume exports are
    enabled. From the earlier example, replacing <volume-name> with
    posix-ac, will disable mounting of the posix-ac volume as a whole.

    performance/write-behind: explicitly enforce ordering of overlapping writes.
    
    - If there are non-contiguous offsets (offsets which do not start where
        previous write ended), wait for completion of previous writes to server,
        before sending new ones.
      - Send flush call to server only when all writes are completed.
      - If a file is opened with O_APPEND, at any point of time a maximum only one
        write call to server should be in transit. This is to avoid reordering of
        writes in the presence of afr which can result in data corruption.

Author: Amar Tumballi <amar@gluster.com>
Date:   Tue Jun 29 05:36:30 2010 +0000

    minor fixes in rpc + protocol
    
    * proper use of mem_acct_init in client.c/server.c
    * fentrylk_resume to be called instead of finodelk_resume in
      server_fentrylk().
    * handle the case of xdr decoding failure on server by sending the
      proper error reply to client, so there is no missing frame.
    * removed unwanted functions from server-helpers.c

Date:   Tue Jun 29 03:39:16 2010 +0000

    backward compatibility of protocol
    
    * made most of the 'legacy' server and transport functions as
     'static' as they were getting cross linked with newer functions.
    
    * changed the name of few functions with prefix 'gf_'

    * rpc_clnt_submit() now takes 'cbkfn' as an argument.
    * readdir xdr now uses dirent structure directly instead of
      using 'opaque' buffer through which it was serializing /
      unserializing the dirent structure.
    * 'gfs_id' field (currently used for debugging) is properly updated

    nfs3: Special-case the lookup for parent dir of root
    
    When a lookup request comes in for (rootfh, ".."), we need to handle
    it in a way that returns the attributes and handle of the root dir.
    Not doing so crashes nfsx because the inode table is not able to
    find a inode for the root's parent. This inode was being referenced in
    nfs3_lookup_parentdir_resume when filling a loc for the lookup fop.
    
    For the record, such a lookup request is sent by vmkernel.

    In the readdir reply for the root of the export, replace the ino
    and gen number for the . and .. entries with 1 and 0 respectively.
    On clients which inspect this field, the client will error out due
    to the change in inode number of the root directory when see for "."
    
    .. also needs to be replaced because we do not have a concept of
    the parent directory of root. The return of 1 and 0 is the same as
    the behaviour of: stat /.. command.

Date:   Wed May 26 04:11:22 2010 +0000

    performance/write-behind: explicitly enforce ordering of overlapping writes.
    
    - If there are non-contiguous offsets (offsets which do not start where
        previous write ended), wait for completion of previous writes to server
        before sending new ones.
      - Send flush call to server only when all writes are completed.
      - If a file is opened with O_APPEND, at any point of time a maximum only one
        write call to server should be in transit. This is to avoid reordering of
        writes in the presence of afr which can result in data corruption.
        See bug #934 for more details.

    nfs: Introduce trusted-write and trusted-sync options
    
    Introduces two new options:
    
    1. nfs3.*.trusted-write: Forces UNSTABLE writes to return STABLE to NFS
    clients to prevent the clients from sending a COMMIT. STABLE writes
    are still handled in a sync manner and so are COMMITs if they're sent
    at all.
    
    2. nfs3.*.trusted-sync: Forces all WRITEs and COMMITs to return STABLE
    return flags to NFS clients to avoid the overhead of STABLE writes, and
    COMMITs that follow UNSTABLE writes. This includes the trusted-write
    functionality. In addition to the trusted-write, it also writes
    STABLE writes in an UNSTABLE manner.
    
    Both violate the NFS protocol but allow better write perf in most
    configurations. Use with caution.

    glusterfs-profiler: Add text mode support.
    
    glusterfs-profiler works in text mode by default now. This allows it to run on systems which don't have matplotlib installed.
    
    Modes can be selected using:
    
      -m graph        - Graphical mode
      -m text         - Text mode (default)

    extras: Add NFS-specific log analyzer tool
    
    Most of the time, a NFS request and the reply are separated by hundreds
    of lines of other debugging output most of which is not always relevant
    for NFS debugging. This script synthesizes the full glusterfs log into
    the parts relevant for NFS while bringing together the NFS requests with
    there replies on one line.
    
    Min log-level required for this script to be useful is DEBUG. Only
    works for NFS translator.

    nfs3: Round-up read reply bytes of multi-vector reply
    
    A previos commit brought in support for returning read replies
    when subvolumes return reads in multiple iovecs. This did
    not completely fix the problem since the bytes in iovecs
    all together could be unaligned with the 4 byte
    boundary as needed by XDR for the opaque data. This resulted
    in read requests being either retransmitted or rejected with
    an error message in syslog on the NFS client.

    bringing the return values in line with what the callers

    posix: Support thread-safe vectored writes/reads
    
    ..by maintaining internal offsets and using pwrite/pread
    instead of writev/read.
    
    The recent io-threads change is causing concurrent writes to
    a file from different io-threads. This results in a race between
    two threads both of which are trying to call lseek-writev. The
    lseek-writev sequence should be a critical section. This is where
    pwrite syscall helps. pwrite also requires an offset to be given so
    for supporting pwrites for multiple iovecs we maintain an offset
    within posix for the duration of the write fop and pass this internal
    offset to pwrite.
    
    The same logic also applies to read, only difference is that we do
    not need to read multiple iovecs but only provide an atomic
    lseek-read sequence.

    nfs3: Use nfs3state in call_state to avoid getting from rpc request
    
    This change avoids having the nfs translator depend on the sanity
    of the rpcsvc_request_t type after NFS reply has been sent. This
    was a problem because the request structure is guaranteed to be
    invalid after the reply for the request has been submitted by the
    RPC program. NFS3 handler was ignoring this behaviour and accessing
    the private in request after reply submission resulting in access to
    corrupted data.

    core: Do internal latency measurement of FOPs.
    
    This patch adds a facility by which each translator
    keeps track of the average latency of a FOP from
    its point of view. That is, the duration between
    the translator handing over the call to a lower-level
    translator and the reply coming back.
    
    The latency measurement is off by default, and can
    be toggled by sending SIGUSR2 to the GlusterFS process.
    
    Latency data is printed as part of the process state dump.

    nfs: Redesign fop argument passing to support single volfile use
    
    The current design of the interaction between the generic NFS layer and the
    protocol handlers like mount3 and nfs3 is such that it does not allow using a
    single volume file which contains the nfs/server and the protocol/server.
    This is because the common nfs-fops layer assumes that ctx->top is always the
    nfs/server. This is wrong. The fops layer needs access to top because top or
    rather the generic NFS xlator's private state has a mem-pool. The fops layer
    needs this mem-pool to get memory for storing per-fop state. Since the fops
    layer cannot anymore take ctx->top be the nfs/server, all layers need to start
    passing the nfs/server xlator_t right down to the fops layer.
    
    I am also taking this chance to remove the synchronous equivalents of the fops
    and also remove the dirent caching directory operations.

    stripe: logic fixes
    
    * for setting 'local->failed'
      Earlier, stripe was not handling different errors from subvolumes,
      and hence failure testcases using 'debug/error-gen' were failing.
      With this fix, tests pass fine.
    
    * proper event handling in notify.
      Send CHILD_UP and CHILD_DOWN events properly.

    distribute: Save ino/dev from first subvolume during mkdir
    
    A self-heal on directory creation results in the subsequent
    call to dht_selfheal_new_directory to happen only for the last subvolume.
    But when this function is called for the last subvol it is possible
    that the st_ino returned in this function's callback is the st_ino
    from the hashed subvolume(assigned in dht_mkdir_hashed_cbk).

    distribute: Respect end-of-dir on readdir only for last subvol
    
    We need to ensure that only the last subvolume's end-of-directory
    notification is respected so that directory reading does not stop
    before all subvolumes have been read. That could happen because the
    posix for each subvolume sends a ENOENT on end-of-directory but in
    distribute we're not concerned only with a posix's view of the
    directory but the aggregated namespace' view of the directory,
    which is maintained by distribute.

    posix: Support EOF for file reading
    
    This is a small hack to notify higher translators that an end-of-file
    was encountered at the end of the readv operation. This is helpful
    in determining end-of-file without sending another readv fop.

    posix: Support end-of-stream determination
    
    state, higher translators do not need to perform another readdir
    to determine end of stream. Instead, if a successful directory
    read operation is accompanied with an op_errno=ENOENT, it means
    end-of-stream on the directory fd_t.

    cluster/afr: Failover readdir calls.
    
    This patch makes the replicate readdir call fail over to the next
    subvolume if the first call fails. It takes care to ensure that
    entries are not duplicated.
    
    The failover behavior of readdir only comes into effect if
    the option 'strict-readdir' is on.

    performance/write-behind: fix data corruption while aggregating the adjacent contiguous iobufs into a single iobuf
    
    - while aggregating, we should make sure that the destination has enough
       memory. __wb_collapse_write_bufs assumed that destination vector's iov_base
       was aligned to the start of an iobuf and hence memory of page_size is
       available for aggregation. This assumption is not always true, like in the
       configuration consisting afr->write->io-cache (afr is on top). Refer to the
       bug url for more details.

    dht: Remove pointer casting in layout handling
    
    Small changes by Anand Avati <avati@gluster.com> over original submission:
    
    Remove pointer casting (copy data to proper memory before using it). Fixes bug #493.
    Hello,
    
    See bug #493 for more information on this patch.
    
    http://bugs.gluster.com/cgi-bin/bugzilla3/show_bug.cgi?id=493#c2
    
    This patch assumes that the scope of disk_layout is local wherever it is
    used. Seems correct, not really checked, though.

    The previous patch I submitted for this file (afr's self-heal code)
    introduced a terrible error. I overlooked the error checking in the
    original code and misplaced the memcpy (too early).

    storage/posix: Fix device number handling.
    
    There are two fixes in this patch:
    
    1) If the device number has changed, do a fresh stat on the export
       directory and if it matches the device number of the file,
       assume a remount happened and remember the new device number
       as official (this helps automounted export volumes).
    
    2) Don't log the "device number changed" message if it is due
       to a stat on ".." (in posix_readdirp), as it could be because
       ".." leads us out of the exported volume.

    Server backend storage hang should not cause the mount point to hang.
    
    Submitted-by: Krishna Srinivas <krishna@gluster.com>
    NOTE: fixed compilation issues in posix.c introduced while merging
    
    storage/posix polls for FS/kernel being functional by issuing
    statvfs() call. In case statvfs expires the timer, storage/posix will
    send CHILD_DOWN to upper translator. Ultimately this will cause
    protocol/server to disconnect all clients connected and also cleans up
    the data structures. Hence if soft lockup or other kernel bug causes
    backend FS to hang, the clients will not be hung.

    cluster/unify: don't call xl_init_tree on namespace node.
    
    - just before xl_init_tree call on namespace, unify node is set as parent of
        namespace node and since xl->ready of unify node is set only after return
        from init call, calling xl_init_tree on namespace node will result in
        execution of init of unify node for the second time. This results in
        following bugs:
    
        * since during second execution, parent of namespace node is unify, init of
          unify xlator fails.
        * even if init did not fail, re-execution of init in itself is bad, since it
          results in memory leaks etc. Worse, it can result in infinite recursive
          calls into init of unify node.

    fuse: add mtab entry asynchronously
    
    Instead of taking libfuse's approach to the bug referred
    -- making use of an ad-hoc mount option --, we get over
    the issue by not waiting for mtab manipulation to complete.
    If mtab manipulation happens to fail for some reason, just
    log an error message (instead of aborting the mount).

    More robust dictionary (un)serialization (fixes bug #397).
    
    Hello,
    
    This patch fixes bug 397: dictionary (de)serialization used pointer
    casting which forced word-alignment on (at least) armv5tel, causing
    corruption while writing and reading buffers into memory. It also adds
    some debugging (more information in case of errors).
    
    I tried to send this a few times already but I think it got bounced from
    the list.

    resolver: handle resolutions of paths
    
    support a new type of resolution where only the path is sent from the
    client over the wire without inode/parent/generation numbers. this can
    happen when cluster translators could not look up inodes on a server
    and later when the server comes up applications issues operations on
    the inode without a lookup (since they could be cd'ed inside). In these
    cases the server makes the best attempt to resolve the path and perform
    the fop on it

    This patch solves the lock bailout problem seen recently when autoconf tools were run. This is a workaround,
    where 'flock' locks are removed in pl_release, if an explicit UNLCK call does not come. The complete fix would
    be to allow 'fcntl' and 'flock' locks to operate in different domains.

    performance/stat-prefetch: don't check whether previous lookups have been failed in sp_process_inode_ctx.
    
    We need this patch for following reasons:
       1. The inode used in the successful lookup call may not be the one passed to
          fops operating on path. This may happen, if revalidate of inode is failed,
          but the lookup itself succeeds (in case of reavalidate failures, fuse
          sends a fresh lookup using new inode) and since inode_link, if there is an
          inode already associated with a path retains it.
       2. Only fops that "wait" in stat-prefetch for a lookup which is already in
          progress, need to check for the result of the lookup they are waiting on,
          before resuming and sp_process_inode_ctx is _not_ used in such contexts.

    mount/fuse: Refactored fuse_setattr.
    
    If both truncate & setattr need to be sent from fuse_setattr,
    they are now sent one after the other (setattr first, and then truncate)
    instead of being sent parallelly. The earlier code that sent them parallelly
    had a couple of problems:
    
    1) A bug in the logic that would sometimes cause the setattr call
       to never return, making the application hang.
    
    2) A possibility that truncate and setattr would race at the server/io-threads/posix
       end, thus returning the wrong stat structure to the application.
    
    This patch also removes an unneccessary "can_fuse_return" call in
    fuse_attr_cbk, which would cause a call to hang if STAT or FSTAT failed.

    core, client, server: Support auxiliary group ids
    
    Support for auxiliary group ids is needed for transmission
    of more than one group id right through the xlator tree
    so that posix can use these group ids to perform
    in-house permission tests. The in-house permission checks are
    needed so that we do not have to depend on non-POSIX calls
    like setfs[ug]id for changing the user for each fop.
    
    The setfs[ug]id  are also limited since they do not allow setting
    multiple group id as required for operation with NFS, which sends
    us all the group ids for a process issuing file system requests.

    libglusterfsclient: Separate order of path compaction and VMP search for abs and rel paths
    
    The previous set of changes for relative paths in libglusterfsclient
    break the absolute path operation. The fix involves differentiating
    between absolute and relative paths in terms of the order
    in which the 2 operations are performed:
    
    - path compaction
    - VMP search
    
    For absolute paths, since we assume that VMP is already perfixed to the
    path, we need the following order of operation:
    
    1. VMP search
    2. path compaction on the path components beyond the VMP.
    
    For relative paths, the operations are reversed because there
    we do not have a VMP pre-fixed in order to perform a VMP search.
    This means that a path compaction combined with prepending of the
    CWD is needed to get an absolute path before the VMP is searched for.

    features/trash initial cleanup commit
    
    * support O_TRUNC flag in open (call comes to FS as 'truncate'
      or 'ftruncate' fop)
    * option to provide 'eliminate-pattern' so those files matching
      won't be kept in trash. Eg:
          option eliminate-pattern *.out|*~
    * option to give 'maximum' file size to keep in trash, ie, when a
      20GB file is deleted, it won't be kept in trash if max file size
      given is 1GB. Eg:
          option max-trashable-file-size 1GB

    stat-prefetch: fix unsafe reference to @local in sp_lookup_cbk
    
    stat-prefetch uses the main syscall frame for performing lookup on
    demand. this causes a potential reference to a freed local in

    have unwound and destroyed)

    performance/stat-prefetch: make lookup to wait for the completion of another lookup on same path if one is in progress.
    
    - If current lookup (2) does not wait for completion of the lookup (1) which
        is in progress, there can be a race condition where (2) completes ahead of
        (1) and resuming all the waiting operations in the queue. When (1) returns,
        the original operation (eg., stat, chmod etc) might've already unwound and
        hence the frame would've been destroyed.

    moved unify from 'cluster/unify' to 'legacy/cluster/unify'
    
    maintaining unify is not feasible, and its design of namespace is
    not scalable too. hence moving it to 'legacy/' directory..
    
    Thanks to unify, we learnt something about rename(). 'cluster/unify' has
    served GlusterFS well for more than 2years, and its the time to say
    goodbye :-(

    Changes in libglusterfs/rbthash:

    The mem-pool argument would be mutually exclusive to expected_entries.
    If expected_entries is provided, mem-pool would be ignored and vice-versa.
    
    Changes in io-cache:
    1) Moved rbthash creation to readv.
    2) rbthash makes use of 1 rbt instead of 4096
    3) A global mem-pool is being used in place of a mem-pool per rbt.

    performance/stat-prefetch: don't free the cache in readdir if the offset is not the expected one.
    
    - cache creation is expensive operation. Also, cache will be freed in
        releasedir. Hence, just remove all entries from cache without freeing
        the cache. However this is not entirely true, since sp_cache_remove_entry
        frees the old table and reinitializes a new table if all entries are being
        removed. When rbtree based hash table provides an interface to remove all
        the entries, sp_cache_remove_entry should be modified not to destroy the
        table.
    
      - this patch also fixes a race condition wherein the cache being used in
        lookup getting freed in readdir if the offset is not equal to expected
        offset.

    cluster/afr: Do self-heal on reopened fds.
    
    This patch brings in partial support for self-heal of open
    fds. The precondition is that the fd should have been opened
    successfully during the initial open() (or create()), and we
    assume that protocol/client has successfully reopened the fd
    when the subvolume comes back up.
    
    It works by doing an "up/down flush" (a dummy flush transaction
    to do post-op wherever necessary) and then triggering
    data self-heal on the file in the post-post-op hook of the
    dummy flush transaction. This ensures that any writes
    that come in during self-heal will wait until self-heal completes.
    
    The up/down flush is also done when a subvolume goes down,
    so that post-op is done on all subvolumes where pre-op was done.

    libglusterfsclient: fix memory leak.
    
    - glusterfs_glh_getxattr was implemented using libgf_client_lookup. Hence the
        inode corresponding to the path on which getxattr was done was refed twice
        - one during path_lookup and the other in libgf_client_lookup - but unrefed
        only once.
      - with inode generation number changes the inode returned by inode_link may
        not be the same as the input argument. Hence the inode returned by
        inode_link should be used, not the one returned in libgf_client_lookup_cbk.

    transport/ib-verbs: fix race-condition resulting in freeing of transport while it was still being used.
    
    - while handling a failed work completion status, the transport is
        disconnected. But further down in the code, the transport is still
        used. There can be a possibility that transport might've been freed
        by the time control reaches this point. More detailed description of
        events leading to this situation can be found at

    - There can be a condition wherein,

        2. the thread waiting for events on socket (thr 2) calls transport_receive,
           but in ib_verbs_receive it has not still read the data.
        3. thr 1 receives work completion event for another work request and
           overwrites the buffer pointer.
        4. thr 2 reads from the new pointer there by missing the data stored in
           buffer pointed by pointer which got overwritten.

    cluster/afr: Ensure directory contents are in sync during opendir.
    
    The problem: If some files on the first subvolume disappeared
    without leaving a trace in the entry changelog (this can happen,
    for example, when an fsck has deleted files or when a hard drive
    is replaced), those files would never be self-healed even though
    they would be present on the second subvolume. This is because
    readdir is sent only to the first subvolume, and since the files
    don't appear in the directory listing, no lookup would ever be
    sent on them.
    
    This patch fixes this problem by doing a readdir on all the subvolumes
    during the first opendir on a directory inode. If a discrepancy in the
    contents is detected, entry self-heal in a special "force merge" mode
    is triggered on that directory.

    cluster/dht: Do readdir in dht_readdir instead of readdirp
    
    The readdir call will not be used by applications (fuse will
    only ever send readdirp), but it will be used by
    afr to do directory self-heal at the time of opendir.

    * Rename glusterfs-volgen.py and include it in the rpm spec file
    * Enable fusermount by default. Change fusermount configure option from disable to enable.
    * Remove BDB from configure.ac, essentially removing it from the normal build.
    * Remove all dependencies on fuse in the rpm spec file.

    transport/name.c: refine the address resolution logic when listen-host is not specified.
    
    - when listen-host is not specified and there are are no interfaces having
        adresses belonging to the address-family specified, listen at 0.0.0.0/::0.
    
      - this patch is necessary since with AI_ADDRCONFIG, getaddrinfo fails if there
        are no active interfaces for the address family specified and when
        listen-host is specified we still want the functionality provided with
        usage of AI_ADDRCONFIG.

    cluster/afr: Move deleted files to /.trash in entry self-heal.
    
    If entry self-heal determines that a file/directory should
    be deleted from a subvolume, move that entry to a directory
    called "/.trash" on that subvolume. This is for two reasons:
    
    1) It limits the damage that can be done by a "wrong" entry
       self-heal.
    
    2) It solves the problem of a to-be-deleted directory not
       being empty.

    performance/io-cache: change the hash function used for rbtree based hash table.
    
    - the earlier hash function does not distribute pages uniformly for offsets that
        fit into 32 bits. The reason is that the hash function just xors the contents of
        the key 4 bytes at a time with the current value of hash. Hence for keys that
        fit into 32 bits, the hash will be the key itself. Since we are using the
        rounded_offset (which is a multiple of 128KB) as the key, the key will
        be exactly divisible by the number of buckets configured (4096) resolving all
        the pages into the first bucket.

    storage/posix: Ensure time(2) is stored in a 64-bit variable.
    
    Before multiplying the time_t value by 2^32, store it in a
    64-bit variable. This is necessary on 32-bit systems, where
    time_t is only 32-bits, and left-shifting by 32 results in 0.

    booster: seperate out the implementations of readdir and readdir64.
    
    - readdir and readdir64 should not call same procedure booster_readdir
        in their implementation, since the layout of dirent structures returned by
        libc implementations of readdir and readdir64 is different (readdir returns

    This patch introduces a new option "background-self-heal-count", with a

    cluster/afr: entry self-heal: Set parent directory's attributes using a new frame.
    
    There was a race condition in assuming that afr_sh_entry_impunge_parent_setattr_cbk will
       always return before impunge_xattrop_cbk and impunge_setattr_cbk.
    
       This patch fixes two additional problems:
    
    1) Building the parent_loc from impunge_local->loc after STACK_WIND to
       impunge_xattrop_cbk has happened. In a simple afr-posix configuration
       the stack will have been destroyed by the time building of parent_loc is
       attempted.
    
    2) parent_loc built in impunge_newfile_cbk was not being loc_wipe'd.

    performance/stat-prefetch: fix memory leaks
    
    - sp_cache_get_inode uses fd_lookup which internally increases the refcount of
        fd by 1. This needs to be unrefed once we get the cache.
      - for directories, stat is stored in the inode context in sp_lookup_cbk.
        but, while doing so, no check was being done for the presence of context
        in inode, resulting in leak of memory equal to sizeof (struct stat) when
        multiple lookups happened on the directory.
      - path constructed in sp_readdir was not freed.

    libglusterfsclient: Clean up fini and umount code paths
    
    This patch cleans up the umount and fini paths in preparation
    to support waiting for unwind of all pending call frames.
    
    Two misc fixes are:
    1. Fix to avoid deadlock in _libgf_umount by
    using _libgf_vmp_search_entry instead of
    libgf_vmp_search_exact_entry since the latter tries to take a
    lock already help by _libgf_umount.
    
    2. Avoid a crash in _libgf_umount by deleting the vmp
    entry from the list before it gets freed.

    due to a previous logging enhancement patch is a bit too

    libglusterfsclient: Re-validate root inode on every path resolution
    
    If the root inode's is outdated, send a revalidate on it.
    A revalidate on root inode also reduces the window in which an
    op will fail over distribute because the layout of the root
    directory did not  get constructed when we sent the lookup on
    root in glusterfs_init. That can happen when not all children of a
    distribute volume were up at the time of glusterfs_init.

    performance/write-behind: Add a NULL check for request->stub before checking request->stub->fop.
    
    - for non-write wind requests, the request structure outlives the stub.
        The call stub is destroyed when stack is wound but request is destroyed
        only when the reply has come.
        (for writes, both stub and request are destroyed when refcount becomes 0,
         which happens only when the write operation is stack unwound and a reply
         for the write operation has come from underlying translators, for non-write
         unwind requests the request is first destroyed before resuming the stub).

    - With this option enabled, writes are stack-wound even though not enough

        stack-wound but reply is yet to come. The reason behind this option
        is to make use of the network, which is relatively free (with no writes
        or replies in transit). However, with non-standard block-sizes of writes
        the performance can actually degrade. Hence making this configurable.

    client-protocol: fix race-condition encountered while accessing fdctx
    
    - In protocol/client, fdctx is accessed by two sets of procedures,
      protocol_client_mark_fd_bad falls in one set whereas the other set consists of
      all fops which receive fd as an argument. The way these fdctxs are got is
      different in these two sets. While in the former set, fdctx is accessed
      through conf->saved_fds, which is a list of fdctxs of fds representing
      opened/created files. In the latter set, fdctxs are got directly from fd
      through fd_ctx_get(). Now there can be race conditions between two threads
      executing one procedure from these two sets. As an example let us consider
      following scenario:
    
      A flush operation is timed out and polling thread executing
      protocol_client_mark_fd_bad, fuse thread executing client_release. This can
      happen because, immediately a reply for flush is written to fuse, a release on
      the same fd can be sent to glusterfs and the polling thread still might be
      doing cleanup. Consider following set of events:
    
      1. fuse thread does fd_ctx_get (fd).
      2. polling thread gets the same fdctx but through conf->saved_fds.
      3. Now both threads go ahead and does list_del (fdctx) and eventually free
         fdctx.
    
      In other situations the same set events might occur and the threads
      executing fops other than flush in the second set might be accessing a
      fdctx freed in protocol_client_mark_fd_bad.

    performance/quick-read: access glusterfs_ctx from xlator instead of using glusterfs_get_ctx
    
    - since glusterfs_get_ctx gets the global context pointer, there can be
        problems in a multithreaded application running on libglusterfsclient
        doing multiple glusterfs_inits. Hence use context specific to the
        current xlator tree stored in each xlator object.

    booster: use __REDIRECT macro to prevent creat being renamed to creat64.
    
    - nm on libglusterfs-booster.so shows only creat64 defined but not creat. This
       behavior is observed due to following reasons.
    
       1. Booster is compiled with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64.
       2. fcntl.h when included with _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 defined, renames all
       occurences of creat to creat64 in the source code from the point of
       #include <fcntl.h>.
    
       fcntl.h should be included since booster.c uses many of the macros defined in
       that header and glusterfs (booster in turn) has to be compiled with
       _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 since glusterfs uses datatypes (off_t, stat etc) whose
       sizes vary depending on whether this macro is defined or not. Basically, this
       macro should be defined to provide portability across 32 and 64 bit
       architectures.
    
       The correct fix is to make glusterfs to use datatypes big enough to hold 64 bit
       variants as well as 32 bit variants (like int64_t replacing off_t) and not to
       define _FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64 at all.
    
       As a temporary work around,
       1. we can implement creat functionality in a function with different name, say
       booster_false_creat
       2. rename this function to creat using __REDIRECT macro. since this renaming
       happens after renaming of creat to creat64 (from the first __REDIRECT macro
       in fcntl.h), we will end up with creat symbol being defined in
       libglusterfs-booster.so

    2.0.6 patch for io-cache pattern-matched non-caching
    
    Hello all,
    
    here is a small feature patch. Its intention is to give the user more control
    over the files performance/io-cache really caches. If the user knows exactly
    which files should be cached and which shouldn't there is currently no way to
    tell glusterfs _not_ to cache certain pattern. This patch allows you to
    disable caching by setting the priority of a pattern to "0". If you do not
    give any priority option it works just like before and caches everything.
    Honestly I am not totally sure that disabling caching works the way we did it,
    please comment.

    storage/posix: handle dentries from different mount points in readdir
    
    - If posix translator is configured to have export directories to span accross
        different mount points, inode number is transformed in the dentry returned.
        Otherwise, the entry is not added to list of entries returned in readdir
        callback.
      - storage/posix returns ENOENT if the file is on different mount point other
        than that of exported directory and is not configured for export directory
        spanning across multiple mountpoints during lookup. But, since stat-prefetch
        shortcuts lookup calls, its necessary that readdir return only valid
        dentries.

        2. inode corresponding to dirname of path on which fd is opened. This

    rewriting stat-prefetch translator
    
    - stat-prefetch aims to optimize operations like 'ls -l' where a readdir
       is immediately followed by stat calls on each of the directory entry read.

    libglusterfsclient: Compare compcount with path not maxentry
    
    When searching for an exact entry we need to compare the
    component counts in the candidate VMP and the count in the
    path being searched. This is opposite to the current
    situation where we compare the component count in VMP
    and the component count in maxentry, which will always
    be same.

    libglusterfsclient: Sync access to VMP list on new entry addition
    
    Some weeks back, I'd separated the big lock into vmplock and mountlock.
    See commit 304e4274ca9b0339539581c5413e3339078c1182 in mainline.
    
    At that time, we did not have a solution to the problem
    of when to init the vmplist in a thread-safe manner, since
    there was no lock to protect the vmplock specifically, and that
    when libgf_vmp_map_ghandle was called inside glusterfs_mount
    so the "lock" was already being held.
    
    Now that we have separate mount and vmp locks, the
    accesses can be synced correctly.

    libglusterfsclient: Use components for VMP searches
    
    Till now, we've been doing a character by character comparison
    between a given path and the VMP, to search for the glusterfs

    This does not work for all cases and has been a known bug.

    if the lock's end point is LLONG_MAX, the corresponding
    struct flock's len must be 0.
    
    Previous code had LLONG_MAX and 0 reversed.

    protocol/client: fixed registration of saved_fds
    
    In client_open_cbk, client_opendir_cbk the list_add_tail macros were invoked with wrong
    ordered arguments, causing the existing registered fd list to get unlinked from the
    saved_fds list. The effects of this is far fetched - when transport disconnects, open
    fds are no more marked bad as they are not reachable from the saved_fds list. After
    reconnection, resumed access on this fd causes reference to invalid fds on the server.
    It could appear in the form of 'unresolved fd' error, readdir happening on a file fd,
    files reading from other files, etc.

    libglusterfsclient: Bind fd on fd creation code paths
    
    When an fd_t is fd_create'd, we need to call fd_bind on it to
    ensure that any fd_lookup on the inode gets us this fd. We're not
    doing this so translators like write-behind were not able to order
    path-based requests at all resulting in some fops like stat, which
    could be issued after a writev, overtaking a previous writev which
    is still being written-behind.

    libglusterfsclient: Use iobufs for storing application write data
    
    Till now we've been creating an iovec, storing references in it
    to the application data and simply passing it on to the translator
    tree. This means that the buffer being passed to the translators is
    not at all associated with the memory ref'd by the iobref argument
    to write fop. This is a problem when write-behind is a translator in
    the tree since it assumes that the memory in the iovecs passed to
    write fops is already refcounted by the iobref and so it simply copies
    the address of the application data. The problem is that the application
    can continue using this buffer, free it or over-write it destroying the
    data that write-behind may write at a later time.
    
    The solution involves copying the application's write buffer into
    an iobuf which will be referred to by the iobref.

    libglusterfsclient: Avoid overwrite of inode found through ino number
    
    In libgf_client_loc_fill, there is a possibility that all
    the ino, par and name are specified as non-NULL,non-zero args.
    
    So if an inode is located in the itable using the ino and the
    subsequent search for the inode using the par-ino and the file
    name does not result in an inode being found, the current
    code over-writes the inode that was found through the ino. The
    correct behaviour is to stop further searches if inode

    libglusterfsclient: Fill new loc with target's ino on link
    
    In the loc_t of the link being created, we must fill in the inode
    of the old/target loc since this is a link operation. The
    inode_link to the new parent is called in libgf_client_link.
    
    This fixes a crash while running fileop over a fully-loaded
    dist-repl vol file.

    libglusterfsclient: Move DHT root-lookup workaround to init
    
    The workaround for the DHT requirement for a lookup on /
    needs to be done only once when the xlator graph is inited.
    Doing it on every path's lookup results in a major performance
    penalty when using distribute subvolumes upwards of 16, as reported
    by Avati.

    Implementing quick-read translator.
    
    lookup can fetch the entire file in xattr dictionary using the key
    "glusterfs.content". We set the maximum size of the file that can
    be fetched so in the xattr_req dictionary using the same key. If file-size
    is less than or equal to the value set in dictionary, the content is stored
    in the dictionary using same key in lookup_cbk.
    
    For small files, we can do an optimization wherein we do not really send the
    calls open, read and close to the storage translators. Instead there can be
    an xlator which fakes open, read and close calls. For reads, it sends the data
    it has cached during lookup and hence saving the time for open, read and close
    calls to reach storage translators (this time can be significant if calls have
    to go through network to reach storage translator).

    This needs to be exported in order to have the booster
    Mount Point Bypass technique work through libglusterfsclient.
    Booster uses the mount point to register with libglusterfsclient as
    a VMP. Subsequently, all file operations on the mounted GlusterFS
    mount point get redirected to libglusterfsclient.
    
    This fixes bug 136.

    break inode_path if the length of the path crosses PATH_MAX
    
    a given search for path can't exceed the length of PATH_MAX in any case.
    Hence, its best to make sure by adding a check inside the for loop of
    inode_path, so that it won't enter an infinite loop.

    ib-verbs: don't append ioq_entry to pending_list if first attempt of writing to network fails
    
    * fix to bug #101 - When a buffer bigger than ib-verbs-work-request-send-size
        was attempted to write to network, ib-verbs returns ENOTCONN. Neverthless,
        the ioq_entry corresponding to the write was appended to the pending lists
        of ioq_entries waiting to be written to network. This resulted in double
        free of header, once in protocol_client_xfer and again during cleanup of
        transport. The transport cleanup happened due to the timeouts of
        subsequent operations, since ioq_entry corresponding to writev
        was blocking any other operations from reaching server.

    cleanup client_forget
    
    upon detailed inspection of 'forget' behavior, it became evident that
    forgets from client should not goto server side, as server keeps its
    own purging mechanism to forget its inodes.
    
    if client sends all forget to server, many highly used required inodes
    may get freed up (it will surely effect io-cache buffers on server side)

    cluster/afr - use different dictionaries for sending xattrop requests to each of the subvolume
    
    - This patch fixes bug #29.
      - Using separate copies of dictionaries also eliminates a potential bug in a
        setup consisting of afr with a posix and client, each having io-threads on
        top as children. Since posix_xattrop after performing required operations
        on the xattr array passed in dictionary, sets the result at the same key
        and in the same dictionary passed as input argument,
        there can be race conditions where in the results of the operation on
        posix-child can be sent to the other child as input argument for xattrop,
        which ofcourse is wrong.

    booster: Fix build problems with various libtool versions
    
    We've been facing a problem on some test systems where the
    booster.so is built by libtool as an executable rather than
    a dynamically loadable library.
    
    This problem is probably caused by it seeing a _init function in
    the source. This is the name of the libc initiliazation
    function so it could be the source of the problem.
    
    In any case, ld-preloadable libraries must not have a function
    called _init, instead they need to have __attribute ((constructor))
    as the attribute for any and all functions the library wants
    executed before the program's main(). Our earlier approach was
    inherently problematic.
    This commit also cleans up the booster Makefile for better
    build behaviour. Credit: Harsha.

    libglusterfsclient: Fix glusterfs_mount-vmp search deadlock
    
    It is possible that the only translator in the libglusterfsclient
    tree is the posix. In that case, inside gluster_init, the graph
    init routines will need to call lstat on the posix subdirectory.
    
    Since even the glusterfs stack is running over booster, those
    calls will also first require vmp searching. BUT, the vmp lock
    is the same as the mount lock that was already taken when we entered
    glusterfs_mount, so a deadlock occurs.

    booster: Another attempt to fix 32 and 64 bit interoperability
    
    With this patch, we might have finally arrived at a solution
    to the problem of function definition conflicts between
    our functions and those of libc while over-riding the libc versions.
    
    This commit defines functions which do not conflict with libc,
    then it uses libc's own macro to redirect/rename these functions
    to the actual sys call names in the binary.

    booster: Add new booster-specific fd-table
    
    The reason we need a booster specific fd-table is because
    the libglusterfs fd-table has come to a point where it is
    optimized for libglusterfs-style of fd allocations.
    This conflicts with the way booster requires fds to be allocated
    so this commit brings in a re-based version of a booster-specific
    fd-table written by Raghu.

    - wb_sync did not set local = NULL after stack_wind. It also used to free
        local if its not NULL as part of cleanup process. Hence there was a double
        free in STACK_DESTROY done in wb_sync_cbk.

    libglusterfsclient: Call inode_lookup to prevent pruning
    
    This bug shows up while using unfs3 with replicate. The absence
    of an inode_lookup on a looked-up/created inode results in it
    getting pruned from the inode table. Consequently, a subsequent
    lookup for the inode results in a different inode number being
    returned by replicate. This breaks unfs3 because it tries to remember
    the inode numbers returned by two different stat-family calls.

    io-threads: Fix missed notification in sem_timedwait
    
    We're performing a calculation for skewing idle time
    that resulted in a timespec.tv_nsec value becoming larger than
    1000 million or less than 0, forcing sem_timedwait to return
    with an EINVAL instead of waiting for a request notification
    from sem_post in iot_notify_worker(). This resulted in a missed
    notification that resulted in a hang followed by a timeout
    on the protocol/client side.

    with the user and lot of brain cycle in support team to understand the

    io-cache: prevent frames from getting woken up while page is getting validated
    
    1. A page will be put on the inode waitq if the 'freshness' has to be verified with an fstat()
    
    2. while the fstat is in transit, other calls (like lookup) can update ioc_inode->tv, resetting the freshness (page still on inode waitq)
    
    3. Another read request on the same page, after the updated freshness, will wake up the page frames neglecting the fact that the page is also waiting on the inode (waiting for the fstat completion)
    
    4. once the page's frames are woken, the page becomes elegible for purging and can get destroyed for various reasons, leaving a destroyed page pointer in the inode's waitq
    
    5. fstat returns and hits the destroyed page pointer causing a crash
    
    The fix is to all together disable cache hits when any page of the same inode is under validation. The otherwise cache hit will now be subjected to the ongoing validation by getting queued to the inode waitq.

    unify getdents count reduced to 512 (from 1024)
    
    Thanks to Krishna <krishna (at) gluster.com> for pointing this out.
    
    When a unify self-heal of large directory (directory with lot of entries)
    is done, the getdents_cbk used to fail because of new limit of buffer size
    (128KB). Noticed that earlier it used to streach upto 4MB, hence the value
    1024 worked fine. By reducing it to 512, noticed, we can fit in well within
    128KB limit, and hence unify self-heal goes through.

    libglusterfsclient: Increase readdir block size
    
    This improves the potential for pre-fetching a larger
    number of dirents. Consider that, with 255 chars as the max
    name length for each dirent, in the worst case scenario, where
    we actually have files with such large names, we're not getting
    more than 4 entries with the current block size of 1024.
    
    Generally also, increasing the size to 4k provides us
    with a higher chance that directories with low to medium
    number of dirents will be pre-fetched in a single readdir fop.

    libglusterfsclient: Add dirent pre-fetching and caching
    
    The fop interface is such that we're able to extract more than
    1 dirent in a readdir fop. This commit now enables libglusterfsclient
    to read multiple entries on a glusterfs_readdir call. Once these
    have been pre-fetched, they're cached till either glusterfs_closedir
    ,glusterfs_rewinddir or glusterfs_seekdir are called.
    The current implementation is beneficial for sequential directory
    reading and probably indifferent to applications that do a lot of seekdir
    and rewinddir after opening the directory. This is because
    both these calls result in dirent cache invalidation.

    io-threads: Change mutexes/condvars to spinlocks/semaphores
    
    It seems that use of mutexes is resulting in pretty high thread
    sleep and wake-up cost. What is worse, if a worker thread has
    acquired a  lock, there is a possibility of the main glusterfs thread
    being put to sleep. We change the use of mutexes into spinlock.
    At the same time, we cannot anymore use condvars for notification since
    the condvar interface depends on mutexes itself. Semaphores come to
    out rescue. Luckily, even the pthread semaphores have a timedwait
    interface to allow our idle worker threads to make an exit decision.
    
    Further, it is possible that spinlocks are not available on all systems
    so all this is curtained behind #defines so we can fall back to
    mutexes and condvars implementation.

    io-threads: Support mem-pool allocator for iot_request_t
    
    This commit brings in support for allocation of iot_request_t's
    in io-threads through the use of the mem-pool. We're hoping
    that the overheads of hundreds and thousands of small allocations
    can be avoided through this.
    
    The important point to note is that the memory pool is not
    for the translator as a whole but there is one small memory
    pool for each worker thread. Not only does that help us
    avoid malloc overheads for small allocations like iot_request_t
    but also avoid contention on the heap data structures when multiple
    threads want an iot_request_t from the pool.

    mem-pool: Restructure mem-pool behaviour
    
    This commit changes mem-pool behaviour to return a directly usable
    address by performing the required adjustment on the address
    being returned.
    
    This is different from the previous behaviour where we're trying to fit
    into the requested size, the list_head*2 also. This is not efficient
    enough in terms of space but hopefully works better than not having any
    mem-pool at all. Besides, I am not comfortable with mem-pool meta-data
    and caller-useable memory area being the same because of the potential for
    mem-pool's data structure corruption.
    
    PS:
    Please do read the comments in the code for more info during review.

    libglusterfsclient: Wipe loc->ino in libgf_client_loc_wipe
    
    Not cleaning up the ino member of a loc_t results in SIGABRT
    in __inode_link because in some cases, the loc->ino is
    different from loc->inode->ino. This happens especially in code
    blocks which re-use a loc_t structure for pointing at different
    inodes/files. For eg, if a loc_t has been assigned an inode and
    an ino, and followed by a libgf_client_loc_wipe, then re-use of this
    loc in say libgf_client_lookup results the SIGABRT because
    libgf_client_lookup calls inode_link with the same loc_t. However,
    this loc_t has just been assigned a new inode pointer but the ino
    member still contains a previous inode's inode number. This difference
    in inode numbers results in an assertion failure, so the SIGABRT.

    libglusterfsclient: Revert and re-do readdir conformance
    
    This commit basically reverts the previous readdir conformance
    patch I sent a few days back. That commit had a completely retarded
    and broken way of maintaining per-directory dirent.
    
    It was broken for two reasons:
    1. Creating a wrapper structure around the directory's fd_t
    only for storing a struct dirent is not clean enough. This commit
    takes a better approach by storing the dirent in fd_t context.
    This dirent is valid only if the fd_t refers to a directory.
    
    2. That commit was made and tested under the assumption (..stupidity
    is a better word..) that only opendir call is used for opening a
    directory. That is not correct. Directories are also opened using the
    open syscall. The point is, glusterfs_open returns an fd_t and so did
    glusterfs_opendir. The previous patch actually changed opendir to
    return a new wrapper structure. That is fine, if we go by the POSIX
    definition of open and opendir because, they're both supposed to
    return different types, an int and a DIR*. However, in
    libglusterfsclient, all other code assumes that directory handles
    corresponding to DIR* and file descriptors corresponding to int types
    are the same type, resulting in use of the same locking and fd context
    addition/extraction code. So a directory opened using opendir returned
    a wrapper structure which went down into the libglusterfsclient stack
    where some function called a lock on the handle assuming it was an
    fd_t, since it is not and dereferencing of the supposed fd->inode->lock
    results in a seg fault.
    
    Obviously, this didnt show up till unfs3 used open() to open a
    directory and not opendir.

    transport shortcut b/w client and server
    
    This patch makes the server pass back the transport pointer of the client. If the UUID matches, the client makes the local transport 'shortcut' with the remote transport (pointer received from server)
    
    The shortcut simulates a socket queue. Instead of serialized messages going over the network and getting queued in the tcp socket queue, the messages get queued in a transport specific queue picked by a polling thread.

    libglusterfsclient: Improve readdir conformance on re-entrancy
    
    readdir is supposed to be non-re-entrant only with respect to the
    given dir stream, not the whole process.
    
    What that means is the static struct dirent that we maintain in
    libglusterfsclient should be per-directory handle and not
    process-wide.

    libglusterfsclient: Fix large directory reading bug
    
    As of now, we use 1024 bytes as the buffer for reading directory
    entries. If a directory as many files, then its possible that it does
    not fit into this buffer, thereby requiring more than one call to
    readdir. Now suppose the last bunch of directories fit more or less
    exactly int the 1024 byte buffer. If this happens, the offset
    extracted by the current logic(in libgf_client_readdir) never gets
    updated beyond the first entry in this last block, because the last
    block's first entry always remains same. This explanation is
    convoluted, I know, but I too found out the hard way.

    booster: Add VMP-based open support
    
    In brief, when an open is called the VMP-based open is called first.
    If that fails, the fallback is the Mount-Point Bypass(MBP) technique
    which uses entended attributes to determine if the given
    path is a gluster mount. If it is, it goes ahead to create a
    glusterfsclient handle. All subsequent calls to this real mount point
    get redirected to the glusterfsclient handle. The other fallback is
    the actual open syscall on the local file system itself. This happens
    when the absence of an extended attribute tells us that the path is
    not even a glusterfs mount point.

    We define the O_CREAT, etc. flags so that we can remove fcntl.h from the

    code that redirect application's open and open64 calls to the
    syscalls defined by libc.
    
    For us, thats not a Good Thing (TM).

    booster: Integrate VMP-based mounting
    
    This commit brings into booster the use of VMP based operations
    which will allow users of booster to specifiy a VMP and use it
    for transparently operating on a glusterfs client context.
    
    Since applications are oblivious to booster's presence, because it is
    LD_PRELOAD'ed, we need to specify the VMPs and the corresponding
    options like volfile, logfile, loglevel, through a conf file.
    
    By default, this conf file is the /etc/booster.conf. This can be
    over-ridden through the GLFS_BOOSTER_CONF environment variable
    for the application.
    
    The format of the conf file is very simple for now. Each VMP is
    described on a single line with space separated fields.
    
    Format: <Virtual Mount Point> <volfile-path> <log-file> <log-level>
    
    <log-level> takes the string representation of the usual glusterfs
    log levels.

    libglusterfsclient: Conform'ify glusterfs_readdir
    
    This commit does two things:
    1. Changes glusterfs_readdir prototype to conform to the POSIX
    readdir().
    2. Uses a 1024-byte value instead of sizeof(struct dirent) for the
    @size for libgf_client_readdir. This allows even larger names to fit
    into a single readdir request to the server.

    libglusterfsclient: Fix realpath operation
    
    This commit does two things:
    1. Ensures we go on to traverse nested symlinks by calling realpath
    recursively on the symlink.
    
    2. Makes glusterfs_realpath, a VMP-based operation, return a resolved
    /real path that actually has the VMP pre-fixed to the resolved path.
    If this is not done, we'll be returning a path that is valid only
    within the glusterfs context, i.e. the path will point to a real
    file/dir only if a glusterfs handle identifies which glusterfs context
    the file is in.

    libglusterfsclient: Guard against un-inited VMP searches
    
    On my system, an selinux module gets inited before
    booster even though the FS calls from the selinux module
    get routed through our LD_PRELOAD'ed wrappers. In this
    scenario, the VMP list is un-inited, resulting in a seg-fault
    if it is dereferenced. The list_empty check does not help
    because the pointers in the list have non-NULL values.

    io-threads: Clarify thread count range
    
    This patch cleans up io-threads behaviour regarding the
    range values that can be specified for min-threads
    and max-threads. THe major change is that the min threads
    have been reduced to 2 to signify that io-threads needs minimum
    two threads for its operation, while keeping the default number of
    threads at 16. The idea is to decouple the default thread count
    from the minimum thread count.
    
    Note to Avati:
    This applies over Raghu's indentation and logging take-3 patch.

    fd leak fix
    
    steps:
      - server_finodelk uses req->volume pointer into state->volume
      - finodelk is queued by locks translator
      - c call returns from server_pollin and hdr is FREE'd
      - now state->volname is pointing to FREE'ed region (junk)
      - server_finodelk_cbk calls gf_add_locker
      - gf_add_locker remembers lock with junked path along with fd_ref
      - gf_del_locker from new server_finodelk cannot string match with junked volume thus
        lock is not deleted, hence fd_ref remains as a leak

    compare for mismatching sizes and attributes before overwriting local->stbuf for read-child subvolume. This causes files with differing sizes on backed not to get self-healed if xattrs were missing.
    
    Also add the ESTALE check for compulsorily failing revalidates in case of 2nd unwind and beyond

    posix: Ensure EINVAL return on NULL args
    
    Initing op_errno to EINVAL ensures that this is the value
    that gets returned on STACK_UNWIND, in case any of the VALIDATE macros
    result in exit from "out" due to a NULL argument. If this is not done
    , we get op_ret as -1 with errno set to 0 in the application's
    syscall.

    libglusterfsclient: Fix stat cache bug
    
    The way stat cache gets updated was not consistent across
    all syscalls. Consequently, I was running into a bug that
    returned a 0 st_ino. The fix actually resides in the hunk
    that changes the lines in libgf_client_lookup but similar
    changes were also required in other users of stat cache.
    
    This commit fixes the bug and also cleans up the way stat
    cache is updated.

    libglusterfsclient: Add virtual mount point support
    
    One part of the glusterfsclient library requires users
    to use a handle to address a particular glusterfs context.
    This can become cumbersome for applications that need to use multiple
    such context. For such applications, we make it easy by letting them
    define virtual mount points(VMPs), which are just paths that identify
    a particular glusterfs context. This is done through a new
    glusterfs_mount(..) interface.
    
    Subsequenly, any path based operations, that pre-pend a VMP before
    the files and directories inside the glusterfsd export, get internally
    routed to the correct glusterfs context. This helps users do away
    with the need to maintain their own path-to-glusterfs_handle_t
    mapping.
    
    The old handle-based interface still exists for whoever wishes to use
    it.

    client_protocol_reconnect - do not send notify of CHILD_DOWN event if errno from transport_connect() was EINPROGRES
    
    This bug was racing between a CHILD_UP from poll thread resulting from the event_register() of the new socket called in fuse thread. CHILD_UP would sometimes overtake the CHILD_DOWN for EINPROGRESS. So replicate would receive CHILD_DOWN as the latest event. This resulted in self-heal not happening etc.

    libglusterfsclient: Fix segfault on non-NULL loc->name
    
    The gf_log message actually assumes that loc->name will have a valid
    non-NULL name in it, whereas if the loc_t being passed to it was
    actually created on a function stack, i.e. a local function variable
    and was then passed down the code path to do_path_resolve without ever
    initing it or zeroing the structure, its possible that the name member
    has a non-NULL but corrupted address. This leads to a segfault.
    Whereas, we know loc->path will always have the full path.

    libglusterfsclient: Use macros for argument checks
    
    Having those if {} blocks to check for argument
    validity hurts the eye so this patch replaces those checks
    with macros. One macro already exists in libglusterfs. The second
    macro is introduced by this commit for libglusterfsclient-specific
    check for paths.

    write-behind aggregate-size related changes
    
    This patch brings in following changes:
       1. make aggregate-size as non-configurable and make it to be equal to
          maximum iobuf size.
       2. best effort to write data in chunks of length as close to aggregate-size
          as possible but not greater than aggregate-size, since aggregate-size is
          made equal to Maximum size of iobuf.

    libglusterfsclient: Handle O_CREAT on lookup failure
    
    On lookup failure, if O_CREAT is required, then we must:
    
    1. explicitly lookup the parent directory.
    2. create a new inode for the new file being opened.
    
    This special case is required for file creation because:
    1. We cannot depend on the previous lookup to have reliably looked up
    the parent inode.
    
    2. inode for the new file does not exist in the itable.

    libglusterfsclient: Resolve path on empty caches
    
    The earlier case was that the explicit lookups to the server
    were being sent only when the parent inode was NULL. This situation
    breaks when the parent inode is available in the i- or d-cache
    but the child dirent is not. In such a case, no explicit lookups
    were being sent to get the missing child dirent.
    
    Now, explicit path lookup happens even if the inode for parent or basename
    is not found in the caches.
    
    This also fixes a seg-fault occuring during glusterfs_open, in my test
    case, but one that could occur almost anywhere lookup code is used.

    libglusterfsclient: Fix segfault in glusterfs_open
    
    libgf_client_loc_fill gets passed a name=NULL argument.
    So when this function returns the filled loc argument, this loc
    is actually missing the inode structure that was to be filled.
    
    The segfault actually occurs a few lines later when
    we try to access fd->flags but fd returned by fd_create is NULL
    because we'd passed a NULL inode to it, i.e. the loc->inode.

    io-threads: Refactor ordered worker exit path
    
    This patch re-factors the exit path of an ordered worker
    on a time-out. Earlier we're checking for exit permission
    in such a way that required us to release and acquire
    the worker lock a second time in the worker loop opening
    a window wherein a new request could've been appended to the
    request queue.
    
    This patch makes the decision to exit while still holding on to the
    worker lock.

    io-threads: Support autoscaling volfile options
    
    This commit finally makes the autoscaling feature visible to the user.
    Know that we're now using two separate thread-pools, one for data
    requests, called ordered thread-pool in io-threads, and the other
    for meta-data requests, called un-ordered thread-pool.
    We do not expose this information to the user to keep io-threads
    simple. Consequently, when the user specifies a min-threads and
    max-threads value, the number of threads assigned to each pool
    is equal, i.e. both pools start with their min threads set to half of
    the option "min-threads" and both scale up their threads at most up to
    half of option "max-threads".
    
    Volfile options will be added to the wiki and user-guide.

    This commit adds everything needed to:
    
    a. Get un-ordered request going through the un-ordered

    iot_schedule_unordered(..). The unordered thread-pool
    consists of thread running the iot_worker_unordered(..)
    function.
    
    b. Make threads in the un-ordered thread pool start-up
    and exit depending on the thread state.
    
    Note that at this point the requests that need
    ordering are still going through iot_schedule(..).

    io-threads: Classify requests for threadpool type
    
    New io-threads will serve requests through two separate
    threadpools.
    
    One thread pool for requests that must be ordered
    on a file that is open. so that the server can process the requests
    in the order they were entered in the requests queue, and not in the order
    the io-thread is able to send a request, which in turn is determined
    by how the thread gets scheduled. This can also be called the
    data-intensive ops thread pool.
    
    Second thread-pool for requests that dont care about ordering, i.e.
    requests like lookup, open, create, mkdir, etc.

    unify-self-heal: Fix un-ref'ing of incorrect dict
    
    dict_unref'ing of the dict in local
    results in a crash due to de-referencing a NULL spinlock.
    That is because after a STACK_UNWIND(..), we cannot expect
    the frame->local to be allocated still.
    
    Fix by using the other available reference to local->dict.

    socket_connect() - if socket is already created, do not fail transport_connect() -- causes spurious CHILD_DOWN events to be sent up when reconnect() thread misinterprets the failure of transport_connect() to be an actual teardown of the transport
    
    the spurious CHILD_DOWN events cause self-heal in replicate to not heal files in that subvolume, writev to not modify that subvolume etc, accounting for a lot of discrepencies in replicate which are being in the mailing lists recently.

    IO-threads Cleanup: Clean-up request scheduling and queueing interface.
    
    This patch does two things:
    
    1. Cleans up the request scheduling and queueing interface so that all
    fops only need to call iot_schedule and not iot_queue and in some
    cases iot_schedule.
    
    2. Till now, we've had open and create calls go through the main
    glusterfsd thread when sending open and create fops. This patch makes
    them also go through the worker threads. But since the open and
    creates requests would not be called with a valid inode number in the
    loc_t, these requests will get assigned to the worker at index 0.
    This will be fixed RSN, when we introduce various techniques of
    distributing the inodes(..not requests..) over the worker threads.

    IO-threads Cleanup: Change workers list to dynamically allocated array
    
    Worker threads were represented as a list in iot_conf_t
    which made us traverse the list of workers in order to
    decide which thread gets the request. Now we represent the
    workers as a dynamically allocated array so that we can just index
    into the array to schedule the file.

    Reduce iothreads requests queue lock granularity.
    
    iot_queue() and iot_dequeue() functions were using a io-threads
    translator-wide lock which would be contended for by every worker
    thread waiting for IO requests.
    
    This patch reduces the granularity by turning the
    lock into a per-worker lock.
